To achieve this, these systems need to operate continuously and waste minimal energy, all while extracting useful and compact information from noisy and often incomplete data captured from several sensors in real time. Thanks to their in-memory, event-driven computing capabilities, hybrid memristive complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) neuromorphic architectures provide an ideal hardware substrate for such tasks.Researchers supported in part by the MeM-Scales project set out to demonstrate the full potential of such a system. To this end, they developed a bio-inspired, event-driven object localization system that couples advanced piezoelectric micro-machined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) sensors with a neuromorphic computational map based on RRAM. Their paper published in the journal Nature Communications describes how the proposed neuromorphic approach has made it possible to reduce power consumption by five orders of magnitude compared with conventional localization systems based on microcontrollers.Inspired by natureInspiration for the system was drawn from the barn owl's neuroanatomy. \"Our proposed solution represents a first step in demonstrating the concept of a biologically inspired system to improve efficiency in computation,\" notes study senior author Dr. Elisa Vianello in a news item posted on EE Times. \"It paves the way toward more complex systems that perform even more sophisticated tasks to solve real–world problems by combining information extracted from different sensors.\"We envision that such an approach to conceive a bio–inspired system will be key to build the next generation of edge AI devices, in which information is processed locally and with minimal resources. In particular, we believe that small animals and insects are a great source of inspiration for an efficient combination of sensory information processing and computation. Thanks to the latest advancements in technology, we can couple innovative sensors with advanced RRAM–based computation to build ultra–low–power systems,\" states Dr. Vianello, who is a senior scientist at electronics and information technology laboratory CEA-Leti of MeM-Scales project coordinator French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission in France.The research team conducted measurements of the system consisting of RRAM-based coincidence detectors, delay-line circuits and a full-custom ultrasound sensor. They used the experimental results to calibrate the system-level simulations. These simulations were then used to estimate the object localization model's angular resolution and energy efficiency. The results showed much greater energy efficiency than a microcontroller performing the same task. \"The goal is, as always, to get the best power efficiency for the level of performance needed by a specific application. Further improvements in energy efficiency are certainly possible with our system,\" observes Dr. Vianello.The study demonstrates that combining visual sensors such as dynamic vision sensor cameras with a PMUT-based hearing sensor should be explored to develop future consumer robots.

The record-breaking combination of a shorter charge time and more energy acquired for longer travel range was announced today (Oct. 12) in the journal Nature.\"The need for smaller, faster-charging batteries is greater than ever,\" said Chao-Yang Wang, the William E. Diefenderfer Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State and lead author on the study. \"There are simply not enough batteries and critical raw materials, especially those produced domestically, to meet anticipated demand.\"In August, California's Air Resources Board passed an extensive plan to restrict and ultimately ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars within the state. By 2035, the largest auto market in the United States will effectively retire the internal combustion engine.If new car sales are going to shift to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), Wang explained, they'll need to overcome two major drawbacks: they are too slow to recharge and too large to be efficient and affordable. Instead of taking a few minutes at the gas pump, depending on the battery, some EVs can take all day to recharge.\"Our fast-charging technology works for most energy-dense batteries and will open a new possibility to downsize electric vehicle batteries from 150 to 50 kWh without causing drivers to feel range anxiety,\" said Wang, whose lab partnered with State College-based startup EC Power to develop the technology. \"The smaller, faster-charging batteries will dramatically cut down battery cost and usage of critical raw materials such as cobalt, graphite and lithium, enabling mass adoption of affordable electric cars.\"The technology relies on internal thermal modulation, an active method of temperature control to demand the best performance possible from the battery, Wang explained. Batteries operate most efficiently when they are hot, but not too hot. Keeping batteries consistently at just the right temperature has been major challenge for battery engineers. Historically, they have relied on external, bulky heating and cooling systems to regulate battery temperature, which respond slowly and waste a lot of energy, Wang said.Wang and his team decided to instead regulate the temperature from inside the battery. The researchers developed a new battery structure that adds an ultrathin nickel foil as the fourth component besides anode, electrolyte and cathode. Acting as a stimulus, the nickel foil self-regulates the battery's temperature and reactivity which allows for 10-minute fast charging on just about any EV battery, Wang explained.\"True fast-charging batteries would have immediate impact,\" the researchers write. \"Since there are not enough raw minerals for every internal combustion engine car to be replaced by a 150 kWh-equipped EV, fast charging is imperative for EVs to go mainstream.\"The study's partner, EC Power, is working to manufacture and commercialize the fast-charging battery for an affordable and sustainable future of vehicle electrification, Wang said.The other coauthors on the study are Teng Liu, Xiao-Guang Yang, Shanhai Ge and Yongjun Leng of Penn State and Nathaniel Stanley, Eric Rountree and Brian McCarthy of EC Power.", "abstract": "近日，美国宾夕法尼亚州立大学和宾州州立大学、EC Power公司合作开发出了适用于绝大多拥有高能量密度电池电动车的快速充电技术。该项技术主要依赖于内部热调制，为了让电池始终保持在合适的温度工作，该团队开发出了一种新的电池结构，在阳极、电解质和阴极之外添加了超薄镍箔作为第四种成分，从电池的内部来调节温度。其中，镍箔可以自行调节电池的温度和反应性，这使得任何电动汽车电池都可以在10分钟内进行快速充电。该技术可以将电动汽车电池的使用的能量损耗从150千瓦时减少到50千瓦时，从而缓解开车司机的焦虑。目前，EC Power公司正在致力于制造快速充电电池并将其商业化，以实现汽车电气化的可持续发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-battery-tech-breakthrough-paves-mass.html"}, {"title": "美国多个芯片制造商争夺联邦政府巨额补贴", "keyword": "芯片制造商 联邦援助计划 半导体制造业", "content_zh": "芯片制造商在争取联邦援助时提供巨额投资。世界顶级半导体制造商最近几个月宣布了美国的长期投资，可能超过4000亿美元，理由是来自一项新的联邦援助计划的支持，该计划的规则尚未制定。英特尔、美光、IBM、三星、台湾半导体制造公司和其他公司表示，他们建造或扩大美国半导体制造设施或晶圆厂的计划至少在一定程度上取决于获得联邦资金。这些公司广为人知的声明， 乔·拜登总统参与了英特尔在俄亥俄州的一项奠基工程，并参观了IBM在纽约的一家工厂，这表明了政治、经济和安全动机，这些动机导致国会在8月份颁布了一项旨在恢复美国半导体芯片制造的法律。但这些声明也是在商务部制定分发援助规则的几个月前发布的。商务部管理着法律挪用的近500亿美元赠款。 该部门计划在2月份开始接受申请，第一批赠款不太可能在2024年初夏之前发放。早期的声明及其规模与2018年威斯康星州的一次活动如出一辙，当时美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump)、州长斯科特·沃克（Scott Walker）和众议院议长保罗·瑞安（Paul Ryan）与富士康首席执行官郭台铭（Terry Gou）一起，启动了一个100亿美元的项目，为电视和智能手机制造平板显示器。 四年多后，该公司将项目投资减少到数亿美元，理由是需求疲软和供应商基础不足。争夺芯片赠款的公司没有说他们希望获得多少，也没有说获得低于预期的赠款是否会改变他们的投资计划，但他们正在指望它。英特尔负责政府关系的副总裁阿尔·汤普森（Al Thompson）在接受采访时表示：“我们一直清楚，随着我们做出的每一项声明，芯片法案资助对实施这些计划的重要性。” “我们如此大胆地推动《芯片法案》获得资金的原因之一是，它对我们在美国的投资至关重要。”英特尔尤其直言不讳地谈到了其投资和赠款之间的联系。 今年6月，当立法在国会陷入僵局时，首席执行官帕特·格尔辛格（Pat Gelsinger）警告说，该公司将“缓慢而小，否则我们将根据《芯片法案》(Chips Act）做大而大胆。”英特尔表示，未来十年，它可能会投资高达1000亿美元，在俄亥俄州建设世界上最大的芯片制造综合体之一，其中可能包括多达8家晶圆厂，但初步投资约为200亿美元。 该公司还在亚利桑那州和新墨西哥州开发设施。美光首席执行官桑杰·梅赫罗特拉（Sanjay Mehrotra）也将该公司10月初宣布的在纽约州北部建设晶圆厂的20年1000亿美元计划归因于法律。 “毫无疑问，如果没有《芯片法案》，我们今天就不会在这里，”梅赫罗特拉在宣布计划时说。立法者和政府官员表示，这项立法旨在扭转美国芯片制造业的下降趋势，从1990年的40%降至2019年的11%。 台湾的台积电和韩国的三星是世界领先的生产商，中国正在大力投资建设能力。这些国家的政府提供了大量补贴，帮助这些公司建设能力。建立分配结构商务部的国家标准和技术研究所已经开始通过寻求信息来确定如何分配赠款，包括10月12日要求公司就如何构建该项目发表评论。 这些评论将于11月14日前发表。 一名部门官员只是表示，在评估申请之前，不会做出资金决定。目前的半导体努力在几个方面与富士康的威斯康辛项目不同。 半导体支出结合了联邦支出和税收激励措施，以支持整个供应链，包括长期研究。 富士康项目得到了国家税收优惠政策的支持，以鼓励创造就业机会。 联邦援助是否会扭转半导体制造业持续十年的下降还有待观察。半导体制造业通常需要规模经济，要求公司建立大量产能来降低成本。 台积电和三星各自运营着多个晶圆厂，月产量为数百万片晶圆或光盘，生产单个芯片。这些公司承认，他们现在正在努力使该项目发挥自己的优势。汤普森说：“公司现在正试图寻找合适的方法来确保我们的应用程序包括该部门在劳动力发展、利用私人资本方面寻找的标准，我们将在2月份前准备好。”信息技术和创新基金会(ITIF)全球创新政策总监斯蒂芬·埃塞尔（Stephen Ezell） ", "content_en": "Chip makers offer big investments as they jockey for federal aidThe world's top semiconductor makers have announced in recent months long-term U.S. investments that could rise to more than $400 billion, citing support from a new federal aid program for which the rules have yet to be written.Intel, Micron, IBM, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and others say their plans to build or expand U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities, or fabs, are at least in part dependent on getting federal grants.The companies' widely publicized announcements, with President Joe Biden participating in an Intel groundbreaking in Ohio and visiting an IBM plant in New York, are a sign of the political, economic and security motives that led Congress to enact a law in August meant to revive U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips.But the announcements also came months before the Commerce Department, which is managing almost $50 billion in grant money appropriated by the law, sets rules for distributing the aid. The department plans to begin taking applications in February, and the first grants aren't likely to be awarded until the early summer of 2024.The early announcements—and their size—have echoes of an event in 2018 in Wisconsin where President Donald Trump, Gov. Scott Walker and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., joined Foxconn CEO Terry Gou to break ground on a $10 billion project to make flat-panel displays for TVs and smart phones. More than four years later, the company has reduced the project investment to a few hundred million dollars, citing weak demand and inadequate supplier base.The companies vying for chips grants haven't said how much they hope to get, or whether getting less than expected will change their investment plans, but they are counting on it.\"We've always been clear, with every announcement that we've made, the importance of CHIPS Act funding to carry them out,\" Al Thompson, Intel vice president for government relations, said in an interview. \"One of the reasons why we were so out front and pushing to get the CHIPS Act funded was because of its importance to our investments in the U.S.\"Intel, in particular, has been vocal about the link between its investments and the grants. In June when legislation was stalled in Congress, CEO Pat Gelsinger warned that the company would go \"slow and small or we're going to go big and bold based on the CHIPS Act.\"Intel said it could invest as much as $100 billion over the next decade to build one of the world's largest chip-making complexes in Ohio that may include as many as eight fabs, but the initial investment is about $20 billion. The company is also developing facilities in Arizona and New Mexico.Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also attributed the company's early October announcement of a two-decade, $100 billion plan to build fabs in upstate New York to the law. \"There is no doubt that without the CHIPS Act, we would not be here today,\" Mehrotra said while announcing the plans.Lawmakers and administration officials say the legislation is meant to reverse the decline in U.S. chips manufacturing, to 11 percent of global fabrication capacity in 2019 from 40 percent in 1990. Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are the world's leading producers, and China is investing heavily to build capacity.The governments of those countries provided significant subsidies to help the companies build capacity.Setting up allocation structureThe Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology has begun the work of figuring out how to allocate the grants by seeking information, including a request on Oct. 12 for comments from companies on how to structure the program. The comments are due by Nov. 14. A department official said only that decisions on funding won't be made until it has evaluated applications.The current semiconductor effort differs from Foxconn's Wisconsin project in several ways. The semiconductor spending combines federal spending and tax incentives to support the entire supply chain, including long-term research. The Foxconn project was backed by state tax incentives to encourage job creation. It remains to be seen if federal assistance will reverse the decadeslong decline in semiconductor manufacturing.Semiconductor manufacturing typically requires economies of scale requiring companies to build significant capacity to drive down costs. TSMC and Samsung each operate multiple fabs with a monthly output of several million wafers or discs from which individual chips are made.The companies acknowledge their efforts now to shape the program to their advantage.\"Companies are now trying to look at what is the appropriate way to ensure that our applications include the criteria that the department is looking for in terms of workforce development, leveraging private capital, and we will be ready by February,\" Thompson said.Stephen Ezell, director of global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, or ITIF, said the grants won't affect whether company investments go ahead, but could affect their size.\"Intel has said that they have room for as many as eight fabs in Ohio, and TSMC has said five additional fabs may be possible in Arizona,\" Ezell said in an interview. \"The investments are going to happen, but how truly big are these going to be\" remains to be seen.ITIF was closely involved in working with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., as they were crafting the funding legislation.The law aims to support not only global makers of semiconductors but also suppliers of materials, minerals, chemicals and equipment. In addition to grants, the agency also is seeking feedback on setting aside about $6 billion for loan guarantees that companies could use to raise as much as $75 billion.The Commerce Department's strategy—allocating the grants in three buckets—is also a factor that will determine which companies will be eligible for which parts of the funding:About $28 billion, or three-quarters of the incentive funding, would go toward establishing U.S. production of cutting-edge, high-end processing and memory chips. The money would be distributed through grants and loan guarantees not only to individual applicants but to consortia of manufacturers and suppliers.Another $10 billion of incentives would go toward fabs making \"mature and current generation chips.\"The third bucket, about $11 billion that isn't considered incentive funding, would go for establishing research and development centers set up in collaboration with universities, companies and allies around the world.A separate portion of the law authorizes funding for research and applications in several high-tech areas such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.The department has set up a 25-member industrial advisory board comprised of academics, industry and security experts to advise the agency on the program, and a CHIPS program office whose officials are based at the White House and the department will manage the effort.In addition to the nearly $50 billion in grants and loan guarantees, the law provides a temporary tax credit equal to 25 percent of the tax basis of a qualified property that is part of a chips manufacturing facility.The combination of grants and tax credit is key to achieving Intel's long-term vision of becoming a leading integrated device manufacturer, Thompson said. Unlike TSMC and Samsung, which only fabricate and manufacture chips designed by others such as Apple and Qualcomm, Intel designs its own chips and is now adding fabrication capacity.TSMC and Samsung's concern that the law would exclude foreign companies appears to have been allayed because the text doesn't distinguish between U.S. and foreign companies. TSMC is building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and Samsung is developing a $17 billion fab in Texas and has said it could invest up to $200 billion to expand its facilities.Spreading aid too thinlyGiven the wide gap between potential investment and the nearly $50 billion in government aid, there's some worry that in trying to please everyone the Commerce Department may stretch it thin with each company getting only a small portion, said one industry executive, asking to speak anonymously in order not to alienate the department.But suppliers to major commercial fabs are likely to be smaller and require a smaller portion of the grant money, the executive said: \"Not everything is a $10 billion or a $20 billion project.\"", "abstract": "近日，世界顶级半导体制造商宣布了可能会获得美国超过4000亿美元的长期投资，该投资由美国新的联邦援助计划提供，不过具体的援助金额尚未确定。该计划的推行正处于《芯片法案》背景之下，是多个芯片制造商能获得援助的主要推手，并且该立法旨在扭转美国芯片制造业的下滑趋势。这些争夺芯片资助的公司尚未表明希望获得多少资金，但都信心满满。目前，美国商务部国家标准与技术研究所已经开始搜集信息来确定如何分配这项拨款。商务部的策略是将拨款分为三个阶段，以便更好的决定哪些公司有资格获相对应的资助。然而，美国联邦政府的援助是否会扭转半导体制造业长达数十年的下滑趋势，仍有待观察。目前，该部门已成立一个由25名成员组成的行业顾问委员会，就援助计划向研究所提供建议，并设立一个芯片计划办公室来专门管理这项工作。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-chip-makers-big-investments-jockey.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出一种声波剥离技术来降低半导体成本", "keyword": "声波剥离技术 碳化硅 半导体设备 衬底 晶圆片", "content_zh": "Sonic Lift-off技术旨在降低半导体成本。半导体器件制造要求具有完美平坦和光滑表面的高质量晶圆。 晶圆表面的质量是确保高性能和可靠器件的基础。 为了降低器件的制造成本，必须防止杂质或表面不规则性的形成，这可能在最终组件中引入缺陷，并导致成本增加。Crystal Sonic公司正在开发一种基于声音功率的创新器件剥离和衬底再利用技术。目前，近50%的宽禁带(WBG)器件制造成本归因于衬底材料。 同时，WBG衬底晶圆需求也在增加，主要受汽车、太阳能逆变器、电机和风力逆变器等应用的驱动，尤其是碳化硅（SiC）的需求和可用性之间的差距预计将在未来几年扩大，潜在的SiC晶圆短缺风险。 在射频(RF)和汽车行业以及所有要求高功率密度、高效率、高开关频率和小尺寸的应用的推动下，对氮化镓（GaN）的需求也在快速增长。缩小这一差距的一个有希望的方法是通过衬底再利用技术。水晶声波的衬底再利用技术总部位于亚利桑那州凤凰城，是一家硬科技初创公司，成立于2018年，目标是降低成本和材料浪费，以生产下一代半导体。水晶声波的器件剥离和衬底再利用技术， 它在美国和日本拥有两项已授予和有效的专利（加上另一项正在申请的专利和三项准备中的额外专利申请），来自亚利桑那州立大学(ASU)的玛丽安娜·贝尔托尼教授的实验室。 贝尔托尼领导着能量转换技术缺陷工程（缺陷）实验室，专注于缺陷如何影响材料的电气和光学特性。这项被称为声波剥离的专利工艺，利用声波切割半导体器件制造中使用的单晶晶圆，防止浪费，节省资金。 与传统的研磨过程不同，传统的研磨过程昂贵、耗时，并会对表面和亚表面造成损害，Crystal Sonic的技术使用声音来切割和剥离薄器件层，留下高质量的表面，并可重复使用大块衬底。通过重复使用技术取代机械晶圆背磨，允许制造商将器件的晶圆成本贡献（约占总成本的50%）降低一半，并有可能通过多次重复使用将其降至零。据Crystal Sonic称，下一代半导体器件正在构建在SiC、GaN、砷化镓（GaAs）等衬底材料上。 这些材料生产更小、更有效和更高效的器件，为电力电子、传感、通信和其他领域开辟了新的可能性。由于其可靠性、效率和性能，WBG材料在市场上迅速增长，满足了电子迁移率、光伏、激光二极管、射频和医疗/消毒等大趋势的需求。音速升降装置减薄是后端制造过程中至关重要的一步。 传统的（既定的）方法是机械背磨，但使用效率低、耗时长、成本高（如前所述，整个器件制造成本的50%归因于晶圆），如图1所示，传统制造工作流程的第2步包括器件制造，而第3步是背磨（器件减薄），随后是划片和封装步骤。 在背磨过程中，传统的晶圆和器件减薄制造技术浪费了90%或更多的衬底材料，这些材料无法重复使用。迄今为止，Crystal Sonice已经成功地在小直径Si、GaAs、SiC、GaN和AlN晶圆上进行了演示和原型测试。 在厚度控制、低粗糙度表面和保持器件性能方面，所进行的测试取得了令人满意的结果。 此外，更相关的是，如图3所示，使用重复使用的衬底构建的器件的性能实际上与使用原始衬底相同。传统的晶圆背磨使用金刚石树脂结合剂砂轮来去除晶圆背面的半导体材料，从而降低晶圆厚度。 这是一个遗留下来的和既定的技术，但它是昂贵的，浪费和材料的再利用是不可能的。 除背磨外，目前还有化学(ELO)、机械（剥落）、激光剥离、智能切割（离子注入）和2DLT（远距离外延）等器件减薄技术。 虽然音速L ", "content_en": "Sonic Lift-Off Tech Aims to Reduce Semiconductor CostsSemiconductor device manufacturing requires the availability of high-quality wafers with perfectly flat and smooth surfaces. The quality of a wafer’s surface is fundamental to ensuring high-performing and reliable devices. It is necessary to prevent the formation of impurities or surface irregularities that could introduce defects in the final component and lead to increased costs.An innovative device lift-off and substrate reuse technology based on the power of sound, under development at Crystal Sonic, Inc., aims to lower per-device manufacturing costs substantiallyToday, nearly 50% of wide bandgap (WBG) device manufacturing costs are attributed to the substrate material. At the same time, WBG substrate wafer demand is ramping up, mainly driven by applications including automotive, solar inverters, motor, and wind inverters, particularly for silicon carbide (SiC).The gap between demand and availability of wafers is expected to widen in the coming years, with the potential risk for SiC wafer shortages. The demand for gallium nitride (GaN) is also growing rapidly, driven by the radio frequency (RF) and automotive sectors, as well as by all applications that require high power density, high efficiency, high switching frequency and small dimensions.A promising way to close this gap is through substrate reuse technologies.Crystal Sonic’s substrate reuse techHeadquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Crystal Sonic is a hard-tech startup founded in 2018 with the goal of reducing costs and material waste to produce next-gen semiconductors.Crystal Sonic’s device lift-off and substrate reuse tech, which holds two awarded and active patents in the U.S. and Japan (plus another patent pending and three additional patent filings in preparation), originates from Professor Mariana Bertoni’s laboratory at Arizona State University (ASU). Bertoni leads the Defect Engineering for Energy Conversion Technologies (DEfECT) lab, focusing on how defects can affect a material’s electrical and optical properties.The patented process, known as Sonic Lift-Off, uses sound waves to cut single crystal wafers used in semiconductor-based device fabrication, preventing waste, and saving money. Unlike the traditional grinding process, which is expensive, time consuming and introduces damage to surfaces and sub-surfaces, Crystal Sonic’s tech uses sound to cut and lift-off thin device layers, leaving high quality surfaces behind and the bulk substrate available for reuse.By replacing mechanical wafer backgrinding with reuse tech, allowing manufacturers to reduce the device’s wafer cost contribution (approximately 50% of total cost) by half and potentially towards zero with multiple reuses.According to Crystal Sonic, next-gen semiconductor devices are being built on substrate materials like SiC, GaN, gallium arsenide (GaAs) and others. These materials produce smaller, more effective and more efficient devices, opening new possibilities for power electronics, sensing, communications and other fields.Due to their reliability, efficiency and performance, WBG materials are rapidly growing in the market, meeting demand from megatrends like e-mobility, photovoltaics, laser diode, radio frequency and healthcare/disinfection.Sonic Lift-OffDevice thinning is a crucial step in the manufacturing processes at the back end. The traditional (established) method is mechanical backgrinding, but it is inefficient, time-consuming and expensive to use (as mentioned before, 50% of the overall device manufacturing cost is attributed to the wafer).As shown in Figure 1, Step 2 of the conventional manufacturing workflow consists in the device fabrication, while Step 3 is the backgrinding (device thinning), followed by the dicing and packaging steps. During backgrinding, legacy manufacturing techniques for wafering and device thinning waste 90% or more of the substrate material, which cannot be reused.To date, Crystal Sonice has successful performed demos and prototype testing on small diameter Si, GaAs, SiC, GaN and AlN wafers. The tests performed produced satisfactory results in terms of thickness control, low-roughness surfaces, and preserved device performance. Moreover—which is even more relevant and depicted in Figure 3—the performance of the device built with reused substrate is practically the same as with the original substrate.Traditional wafer backgrinding reduces the wafer thickness using a diamond-resin bonded grinding wheel to remove the semiconductor material from the back of a wafer. This is a legacy and established technique, but it is costly, wasteful and reuse of material is not possible. Moreover, it requires deionized water to wash debris from the surface and prevent contamination.Besides backgrinding, other device thinning methods are currently available, such as the chemical (ELO), mechanical (spalling), laser Lift-Off, smart cut (ion implantation), and 2DLT (remote epitaxy) techniques. Though Sonic Lift-Off is still under development, the solution (also known as acoustic spalling) is the only one able to provide the following characteristics:Tunable lift-off thickness,Fast, scalable process,High-quality surfaces,Multiple reuses andMultiple substrate types.Regarding the sub-surface damage, Sonic Lift-Off provides low roughness (Ra < 1 ?m, to date), minimal or no sub-surface damage, can maintain off-cut angle (due to acoustic control), is a gentler and material-efficient process, and allows reuse of multiple substrates.“Reusability allows device manufacturers to reclaim the most expensive part of the device manufacturing process, which in turn drives down the cost of next generation semiconductor devices,” according to Crystal Sonic.", "abstract": "近日，美国Crystal Sonic正在开发一种声波剥离技术将碳化硅(SiC)晶体等切割成衬底片，由此来减少切割产生的材料浪费，从而大幅节省成本。通常，在制作碳化硅芯片时，由于碳化硅衬底太硬，使用传统切割打磨技术会浪费90%或更多的衬底材料。该公司利用声波剥离技术来将碳化硅等衬底从晶圆片中分离，可以让其留下高质量的表面，实现大块基板可重复使用。这种方法速度快，不浪费材料，并能保持微米级精度的高质量表面。截至目前，该公司已经成功地对小直径硅、砷化镓、碳化硅、氮化镓和氮化铝晶圆进行了演示和原型测试。结果显示，使用声波剥离的衬底构建的器件在性能上与原始衬底相同。该研究让降低下一代半导体设备成本成为可能，拓展了碳化硅和氮化镓在汽车行业、太阳能逆变器、电机和风能逆变器等方面的应用范围。", "link": "https://www.eetimes.com/sonic-lift-off-tech-aims-to-reduce-semiconductor-costs/"}, {"title": "微软将类似ChatGPT的技术植入搜索引擎必应", "keyword": "微软 ChatGPT 搜索引擎 必应", "content_zh": "微软将Chatgpt类技术融入搜索引擎BingMicrosoft正在将Chatgpt类技术融入其搜索引擎Bing，将一项现在远远落后于谷歌的互联网服务转变为一种与人工智能沟通的新方式。微软第二大搜索引擎的改造可能会让这家软件巨头在利用全球围绕Chatgpt的兴奋方面领先于其他科技公司，Chatgpt是一种让数百万人意识到最新人工智能技术可能性的工具。除了将Chatgpt添加到Bing中，微软还将Chatbot技术集成到其Edge浏览器中。 微软周二在华盛顿州雷德蒙总部的一次活动中宣布了这项新技术。微软消费者部门负责人优素福·迈赫迪（Yusuf Mehdi）在接受采访时表示，“认为它比ChatGPT更快、更准确、更强大”，后者使用ChatGPT制造商OpenAI的技术构建，但针对搜索查询进行了调整。周二，新的必应面向注册的桌面用户发布了公开预览，但迈赫迪表示，这项技术将在未来几周扩大到数百万用户，并最终将出现在必应和Edge的智能手机应用程序中。 他说，目前，每个人都可以尝试有限数量的查询。与OpenAI的加强伙伴关系已经酝酿了多年，首先是微软在2019年投资10亿美元，开发了一台功能强大的超级计算机，专门为训练这家旧金山初创公司的人工智能模型而建。虽然这并不总是事实或逻辑的，但ChatGPT对语言和语法的掌握来自于摄入了大量数字化书籍、维基百科条目、指导手册， 报纸和其他在线文章。微软公司首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉（Satya Nadella）周二表示，新的人工智能进步“将重塑我们所知的每一个软件类别”，包括搜索，就像早期个人电脑和云计算的创新一样。 他说，开发人工智能很重要，“要符合人类的偏好和社会规范，你不能在实验室里这样做。你必须在世界上这样做。”向让搜索引擎更具对话性--能够自信地回答问题，而不是提供其他网站的链接--的转变可能会改变广告推动的搜索业务，但如果人工智能系统不能正确处理事实，也会带来风险。 尽管新的必应包含了引用原始数据的注释，但它们的不透明性也使得它们很难返回到他们有效记忆的原始人造图像和文本。“必应是由人工智能驱动的，所以惊喜和错误是可能的，”这是一条出现在必应新主页预览版底部的信息。 “一定要检查事实。”作为它是如何工作的一个例子，迈赫迪要求新的必应比较最有影响力的墨西哥画家，它提供了典型的搜索结果，但在页面的右侧，还编辑了一个事实框，总结了迭戈·里维拉、弗里达·卡罗和何塞·克莱门特·奥罗斯科的细节。 在另一个例子中，他在20世纪90年代的说唱节目中测试了它，展示了它区分克里斯·克罗斯的歌曲《跳跃》和痛苦之家的歌曲《跳来跳去》的能力。 他用它来展示它如何计划假期或帮助购物。高德纳分析师杰森·王（Jason Wong）表示，新的技术进步将缓解导致微软2016年灾难性推出实验性聊天机器人Tay的原因，用户训练该机器人发表种族主义和性别歧视言论。 但王表示，如果必应提供的答案准确性低或所谓的人工智能“幻觉”混淆了数据，微软“声誉风险仍将是首要问题”。谷歌对此类举措一直持谨慎态度。 但为了应对ChatGPT受欢迎的压力，谷歌首席执行官桑达尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）周一宣布了一项名为Bard的新对话服务，该服务将在今年晚些时候广泛发布之前只向一群“可信的测试者”提供。王说，谷歌对ChatGPT的成功感到措手不及，但在面向消费者的技术方面仍比微软有优势，而微软在向企业销售产品方面有优势。据中国媒体报道，中国科技巨头百度本周也宣布了一款类似的搜索聊天机器人，将于今年晚些时候推出。 脸书母公司Meta和亚马逊等其他科技竞争对手一直在研究类似的技术，但微软的最新举措旨在将其置于ChatGPT时代的中心。微软今年1月透露，它将向OpenAI，再投入数十亿美元，因为它希望将ChatGPT、图像生成器Dall-E和其他OpenAI创新背后的技术融合到与其云计算平台以及电子邮件和电子表格等办公产品套件相关的一系列微软产品中。最令人惊讶的可能是与必应的集成， 它是许多市场上排名第二的搜索引擎，但从未接近挑战谷歌的 ", "content_en": "Microsoft bakes ChatGPT-like tech into search engine BingMicrosoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence.The revamping of Microsoft's second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that's awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology.Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.\"Think of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful\" than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview.A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge. For now, everyone can try a limited number of queries, he said.The strengthening partnership with OpenAI has been years in the making, starting with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the development of a powerful supercomputer specifically built to train the San Francisco startup's AI models.While it's not always factual or logical, ChatGPT's mastery of language and grammar comes from having ingested a huge trove of digitized books, Wikipedia entries, instruction manuals, newspapers and other online writings.Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday that new AI advances are \"going to reshape every software category we know,\" including search, much like earlier innovations in personal computers and cloud computing. He said it is important to develop AI \"with human preferences and societal norms and you're not going to do that in a lab. You have to do that out in the world.\"The shift to making search engines more conversational—able to confidently answer questions rather than offering links to other websites—could change the advertising-fueled search business, but also poses risks if the AI systems don't get their facts right. Their opaqueness also makes it hard to source back to the original human-made images and texts they've effectively memorized, though the new Bing includes annotations that reference the source data.\"Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible,\" is a message that appears at the bottom of the preview version of Bing's new homepage. \"Make sure to check the facts.\"As an example of how it works, Mehdi asked the new Bing to compare the most influential Mexican painters and it provided typical search results, but also, on the right side of the page, compiled a fact box summarizing details about Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Jose Clemente Orozco. In another example, he quizzed it on 1990s-era rap, showing its ability to distinguish between the song \"Jump\" by Kris Kross and \"Jump Around\" by House of Pain. And he used it to show how it could plan a vacation or help with shopping.Gartner analyst Jason Wong said new technological advancements will mitigate what led to Microsoft's disastrous 2016 launch of the experimental chatbot Tay, which users trained to spout racist and sexist remarks. But Wong said \"reputational risks will still be at the forefront\" for Microsoft if Bing produces answers with low accuracy or so-called AI \"hallucinations\" that mix and conflate data.Google has been cautious about such moves. But in response to pressure over ChatGPT's popularity, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Monday announced a new conversational service named Bard that will be available exclusively to a group of \"trusted testers\" before being widely released later this year.Wong said Google was caught off-guard with the success of ChatGPT but still has the advantage over Microsoft in consumer-facing technology, while Microsoft has the edge in selling its products to businesses.Chinese tech giant Baidu also this week announced a similar search chatbot coming later this year, according to Chinese media. Other tech rivals such as Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have been researching similar technology, but Microsoft's latest moves aim to position it at the center of the ChatGPT zeitgeist.Microsoft disclosed in January that it was pouring billions more dollars into OpenAI as it looks to fuse the technology behind ChatGPT, the image-generator DALL-E and other OpenAI innovations into an array of Microsoft products tied to its cloud computing platform and its Office suite of workplace products like email and spreadsheets.The most surprising might be the integration with Bing, which is the second-place search engine in many markets but has never come close to challenging Google's dominant position.Bing launched in 2009 as a rebranding of Microsoft's earlier search engines and was run for a time by Nadella, years before he took over as CEO. Its significance was boosted when Yahoo and Microsoft signed a deal for Bing to power Yahoo's search engine, giving Microsoft access to Yahoo's greater search share. Similar deals infused Bing into the search features for devices made by other companies, though users wouldn't necessarily know that Microsoft was powering their searches.By making it a destination for ChatGPT-like conversations, Microsoft could invite more users to give Bing a try, though the new version so far is limited to desktops and doesn't yet have an interface for smartphones—where most people now access the internet.On the surface, at least, a Bing integration seems far different from what OpenAI has in mind for its technology. Appearing at Microsoft's event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the \"the new Bing experience looks fantastic\" and is based in part on learnings from its GPT line of large language models. He said a key reason for his startup's Microsoft partnership is to help get OpenAI technology \"into the hands of millions of people.\"OpenAI has long voiced an ambitious vision for safely guiding what's known as AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a not-yet-realized concept that harkens back to ideas from science fiction about human-like machines. OpenAI's website describes AGI as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\"OpenAI started out as a nonprofit research laboratory when it launched in December 2015 with backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to \"advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\"That changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT model for generating human-like paragraphs of readable text.OpenAI's other products include the image-generator DALL-E, first released in 2021, the computer programming assistant Codex and the speech recognition tool Whisper.", "abstract": "近日，微软正在将类似ChatGPT的技术融合到其搜索引擎必应中，将目前远远落后于谷歌的互联网服务转变为一种与人工智能交流的新方式。除了添加到必应，微软还将聊天机器人技术集成到Edge浏览器中。微软负责消费者部门的高管迈赫迪(Yusuf Mehdi)表示，周二已经向注册的台式机用户发布了新必应的公开预览版，该技术有望在未来几周扩展到数百万用户。通过在必应中使用ChatGPT，微软可以邀请更多的用户尝试必应，尽管到目前为止，新版本仅限于在台式机中使用，还没有智能手机接口。OpenAI首席执行官Sam Altman在微软的发布会上表示，新的必应体验看起来非常棒，他的初创公司与微软合作的一个关键原因是帮助OpenAI技术进入每一个人的手中。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-microsoft-day-war-google-ai.html"}, {"title": "英国开发出用于精确剂量测定的一次性环保传感器", "keyword": "紫外线剂量计 紫外线传感器 瞬态电子产品 剂量测定", "content_zh": "用于精确可穿戴剂量的一次性、环保传感器来自光电进展的新出版物讨论了基于纳米线的可降解高性能光电探测器用于环保绿色电子。传感器负载可穿戴系统在广泛的应用中有很大的希望，包括健康监测、康复、机器人电子皮肤、环境监测、物联网（IoT）等。通常这些应用需要成本有效的一次性传感器用于短期或单次测量。 可穿戴设备中的一次性传感器也有助于克服与可清洗性相关的典型挑战。同样，一次性传感器有助于解决健康监测应用中的卫生要求。 在这些需求的推动下，Dahiya教授和他的同事们提出了基于ZnO纳米线的高性能紫外(UV)光电探测器。 研制的可穿戴、一次性装置能准确测量紫外光强度。 选择了传感材料（ZnO纳米线）和衬底材料（壳聚糖），使该器件在洗涤传感器集成的衣服时在水中无害地降解。 以壳聚糖为基质的ZnO纳米线具有优异的化学稳定性、良好的光学透明性、较大的机械柔韧性和良好的生物降解性，同样，ZnO纳米线具有显著的优点，如(i)成本有效的合成，(ii)对紫外光高度敏感，(iii)环境友好，(iv)生物相容性和(v)生物降解性。 此外，用于一次性传感器的制造步骤是环保的、可扩展的和资源高效的。 其中包括壳聚糖基绿色基片的简易合成，氧化锌纳米线的喷涂，以及丝网印刷实现接触电极。 因此，无论是在传感器的开发过程中还是在其寿命结束时，都会产生微不足道的电子废物。由Ravinder Dahiya教授领导的可弯曲电子和传感技术(BEST)研究小组提出了生态友好的材料和资源高效的制造路线来开发可穿戴紫外线(UV)剂量计，这些剂量计在使用后可以安全地处理，因此不会对环境造成不利影响。不受控制的紫外线辐射暴露是皮肤癌的主要原因。 过度暴露还会损害基因的DNA，从而损害皮肤细胞的生长。 到达地球表面的紫外线辐射量因地区而异。 季节性紫外线强度波动、辐射泄漏和不同的地理位置使得紫外线检测相当具有挑战性。 人们对便携式紫外传感器的开发进行了大量的研究，这些传感器具有新颖的形状，包括柔性和/或可拉伸性。因此，许多可穿戴和一次性消费紫外传感器已经开发出来，并在市场上上市。 然而，可处置性并不一定意味着可生物降解性，这就是许多报告的设备达不到预期的地方，也没有充分解决日益严重的电子废物问题。 Dahiya教授和他的同事们提出了高性能的一次性可穿戴光电探测器，在制造过程中和寿命结束后都不会对环境产生不利影响。我们的环境在不断发展。 为子孙后代保护环境是我们的责任。 目前，我们面临着许多具有挑战性的环境问题。 其中很少一部分，如电子垃圾或电子废物，需要紧急关注以保护生态系统。 电子废物由废弃的电子设备组成，是当今世界面临的重要环境问题之一。成本下降的趋势，以及我们日常活动对资讯及通讯科技设备的需求日益增长，导致消费电子设备的使用量增加。 这导致了全球范围内电子垃圾的无与伦比的增长。 例如，2019年，我们产生了5360万吨电子垃圾。 新冠肺炎疫情进一步推动了“电子垃圾海啸”，这导致虚拟工作成为新的规范。 电子垃圾的处理、再利用和回收需要大量的资源。 此外，大量的化学废物（例如，在光刻和化学蚀刻等过程中）是目前在电子发展过程中产生的。 考虑到这些方面，Dahiya教授和他的团队提出了一套生态友好的材料来开发瞬态紫外传感器，这些传感器在使用后物理上消失。 可持续材料的使用和零废物或低废物的制造工艺将引发对瞬态电子学的进一步研究，并有助于减少电子对环境的不利影响。开发的高性能、适形和一次性 ", "content_en": "Disposable, eco-friendly sensors for precise wearable dosimetryA new publication from Opto-Electronic Advances discusses nanowires based degradable high-performance photodetectors for eco-friendly green electronics.Sensor laden wearable systems hold great promise for wide range of applications including health monitoring, rehabilitation, electronic skin in robotics, environment monitoring, Internet of Things (IoT) etc. Often these applications, require cost-effective disposable sensors either for short-term or for single measurements. Single use sensors in wearables could also help overcome the typical challenges related to washability.Likewise, disposable sensors could help address the hygiene requirements in health monitoring applications. Motivated by these requirements, Prof. Dahiya, and co-workers present ZnO nanowires based high-performance ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors on flexible, biodegradable substrate. The developed wearable, disposable device can accurately measure the UV light intensity. The sensing (ZnO nanowires) and substrate (chitosan) materials were selected to allow the device to harmlessly degrade in water during washing of sensors-integrated clothes. Chitosan as the substrate offers excellent chemical stability, good optical transparency, greater mechanical flexibility, and excellent biodegradability.Similarly, the ZnO nanowires offer distinct advantages, such as (i) cost-effective synthesis, (ii) highly sensitive to UV light, (iii) environmental friendliness, (iv) biocompatibility and (v) biodegradability. Further, the fabrication steps used for disposable sensors are eco-friendly, scalable, and resource efficient. These include facile synthesis of chitosan based green substrates, spray coating of ZnO nanowires, and screen printing to realize contact electrodes. Thus, both during the development of sensors and the end of its life, negligible electronic waste is generated.The Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) research group, led by Prof. Ravinder Dahiya presents eco-friendly materials and resource-efficient fabrication route to develop wearable ultraviolet (UV) dosimeters, which can be safely disposed after their use and thus cause no adverse impact onto environment.Uncontrolled exposure to UV radiation is a major cause for skin cancer. The excess exposure could also damage the DNA of genes and hence the skin cell growth. The amount of UV radiation reaching on earth surface varies from region to region. The seasonal UV intensity fluctuations, radiation leaks and diverse geographical locations make UV detection quite challenging. Significant research efforts have been made for the development of portable UV sensors, with novel form factors including flexible and/or stretchable.Accordingly, many wearable and disposable consumer UV sensors have already been developed and are available in the market. However, disposability does not necessarily mean biodegradability, and this is where many of the reported devices fall short of expectations and do not fully address the growing issue of electronic waste (E-waste). Prof. Dahiya and co-workers present high performance disposable, wearable photodetectors having no adverse environmental impact during their fabrication as well as after the end of life.Our environment is constantly evolving. It is our duty to preserve the environment for future generations. Currently, we are facing many kinds of challenging environmental problems. Few of these such as electronic waste or e-waster need urgent attention to preserve the ecosystem. E-waste constitutes of junked electronic gadgets and is one of the crucial current environmental problems that the world is facing.The descending trend in cost and growing needs of ICT gadgets to perform our day-to-day activities, are leading to an increase in use of consumer electronic devices. This has led to an unparalleled growth of E-waste worldwide. For instance, in 2019, we generated a massive 53.6 million tons of E-waste. The \"tsunami of E-waste\" is further fueled by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic which has led to virtual working becoming the new norm. Significant resources are needed for disposal, reuse, and recycling of E-waste. Further, large chemical waste (e.g., during photolithography and chemical etching etc.) is currently generated during the development of electronics. Thus, attention is needed both during the development of electronics and after the end of life to alleviate the serious threat we face for the environment sustainability.Considering these aspects, Prof. Dahiya and his group have come up with an eco-friendly set of materials to develop transient UV sensors which physically disappear after their use. The use of sustainable materials and zero or low-waste fabrication processes in this work would trigger further research on transient electronics and help reduce the adverse environmental impact of electronics.The developed high performance, conformal, and disposable photodetectors have been demonstrated to monitor exposure to UV radiations which is considered as one of the main risk factors to develop nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Further, the device could be integrated over nonplanar surfaces such as clothes or skin for wearable dosimetry. Such wearable and disposable patches can be used for real-time monitoring of UV radiation under diverse environmental conditions such as mountaineering activities. Lastly, such disposable and flexible UV photodetectors are critical for secure communication and environmental monitoring applications.", "abstract": "近日，由英国格拉斯哥大学领导的研究团队利用生态友好材料和资源，开发出了一种基于传感器的可穿戴紫外线剂量计，剂量计在使用后能够得到安全处理而不会对环境产生负面影响。目前，市场上许多可穿戴和一次性紫外线传感器设备不具有可生物降解特性，为了从根本上解决电子垃圾对环境造成的污染，研究团队使用了一套环保材料开发瞬态紫外线传感器，这些传感器会在使用后会降解消失。研究中使用的可持续材料和零废物或低废物制造工艺将引领对瞬态电子产品的进一步研究，有助于减少电子产品对环境的不利影响。此外，该设备可以集成在非平面表面上，更利于可穿戴剂量测定和在各种环境下实时监测紫外线辐射。最后，这种灵活的一次性紫外线传感器对于安全通信和环境监测应用具有重要作用。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-disposable-eco-friendly-sensors-precise-wearable.html"}, {"title": "俄罗斯开发出使用纳米粒子的净水修复方法", "keyword": "氧化锡纳米颗粒 光催化剂 有机化合物 ", "content_zh": "化学导航：科学家利用纳米粒子开发一种水修复方法来自圣彼得堡大学的化学家开发了一种利用氧化锡纳米粒子基光催化剂从有机化合物中净化水的方法。 这项研究的结果发表在《合金与化合物杂志》上。水污染是一个严重的环境问题。 由于工业的高速发展和废水量的增加，水体的生态正在恶化。 因此，科学家们正在努力开发新的方法来处理工业排放物，以快速和没有不必要的废物来净化复杂的污染物，如有机染料。光催化是废水处理技术中最有前途的方法之一。 这是一个利用光能引发化学反应的过程，通过催化剂--一种以纳米颗粒形式存在的特殊材料--将有机化合物分解为二氧化碳和水。 到目前为止，人们还不知道究竟是什么决定了这种提纯的效率和速度：颗粒的大小，它们的结构特征或组成。 圣彼得堡大学的研究人员找到了这个问题的答案。圣彼得堡大学的化学家提出了一种系统的方法，将特定的污染物与纳米颗粒相匹配，用于光催化净水装置。 所开发的材料在暴露于普通二极管灯的可见光下时表现出光催化活性，在各方面都比以前使用的紫外线灯更便宜和更容易操作。“我们提供了一种全新的方法，可以比作道路导航系统。 例如，在选择前往目的地的路线时，你可以使用普通的纸质地图，根据路标和情况实时绘制路线。“我们提出了一种类似于现代导航系统的算法，对于任何想要的目的地，都会处理几个路线选项，分析当前交通情况，并选择最短的路线。 该项目的首席研究员、圣彼得堡大学普通和无机化学系的早期职业研究员阿纳斯塔西娅·波杜雷特说：“以前光催化剂的材料几乎是随机选择的，今天这个过程变得深思熟虑和有根据。”使用了基于含有三种元素（钴、镍、铜）的二氧化锡的纳米颗粒。 纳米粒子和纳米材料合成与研究团队对不同条件下纳米粒子的形成过程和光催化分解污染物的产物进行了大规模的研究，发现为了制造有效的催化剂，必须以这样的方式组织其合成，即形成一个具有最大数量的氧空位的固体体--当没有单个原子时，晶格缺陷。 正是空位使新出现的电子-空穴对转移到纳米颗粒表面，在那里它们在破坏污染物分子中起着主要作用。 重要的是不要有太多的其他缺陷，否则结果会相反。 这种方法已经被广泛使用的有机染料亚甲蓝和抗生素土霉素证明。利用纳米颗粒修复水的方法的研究也发表在《材料化学和物理》和《危险材料杂志》上。除了光催化之外，科学家们还利用大肠杆菌证明了合成的纳米颗粒的抗菌活性。 由于破坏有机分子的机制与中和细菌的机制相似，有效的光催化剂也能够破坏相应的细菌。研究人员表示，这种方法也适用于其他污染物：需要特殊的计算来理解如何改变纳米颗粒对不同污染物的参数。 ", "content_en": "Chemical navigation: Scientists develop a water remediation method using nanoparticlesChemists from St Petersburg University have developed a method for purifying water from organic compounds using tin oxide nanoparticle based photocatalysts. The findings of the research are published in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds .Water pollution is an acute environmental issue. Due to the high rate of industrial development and increasing volumes of wastewater, the ecology of water bodies is deteriorating. Scientists are therefore working hard to develop new ways of treating industrial discharges that would quickly and without unnecessary waste purify water from complex pollutants such as organic dyes.One of the most promising approaches in wastewater treatment technology to purify water is to use photocatalysis. It is a process in which light energy is used to trigger chemical reactions to break down organic compounds into carbon dioxide and water through the presence of a catalyst—a special material in the form of nanoparticles. Until now, there has been no understanding of what exactly determines the efficiency and speed of such purification: the size of the particles, the features of their structure or their composition. The researchers from St Petersburg University have found the answer to this question.The chemists from St Petersburg University proposed a systematic approach to matching a particular pollutant with nanoparticles for use in photocatalytic water purification units. The materials developed exhibit photocatalytic activity when exposed to visible light from ordinary diode lamps, which in all respects are cheaper and easier to operate than the ultraviolet ones used previously.\"We offer a fundamentally new approach, which can be compared to a road navigation system. For example, you can use an ordinary paper map when choosing a route to your destination, plotting your route yourself in real time, guided by road signs and the situation.\"We propose an algorithm similar to modern navigation systems which, for any desired destination, process several route options, analyze the current traffic situation and select the shortest route. Whereas previously the materials for photocatalysts were chosen almost at random, today this process is becoming thoughtful and well-founded,\" said Anastasiia Podurets, principal investigator of the project and an early career researcher in the Department of General and Inorganic Chemistry at St Petersburg University.Nanoparticles based on tin dioxide containing three elements (cobalt, nickel, copper) were used. The research team of synthesis and research of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials carried out a large-scale study of nanoparticles formation processes and products of photocatalytic decomposition of pollutants under different conditions.The scientists have found out that in order to create an effective catalyst, it is necessary to organize its synthesis in such a way that a solid body with the maximum number of oxygen vacancies—lattice defects when there are no individual atoms in it—is formed. It is the vacancies that allow the emerging electron-hole pairs to be transferred to the surface of nanoparticles, where they play a major role in the destruction of pollutant molecules. It is important not to have too many other defects, otherwise the result will be the opposite. The approach developed has been proven with the widely used organic dye methylene blue and the antibiotic oxytetracycline.Studies on water remediation methods using nanoparticles have also been published in the journals Materials Chemistry and Physics and Journal of Hazardous Materials.In addition to photocatalysis, the scientists demonstrated the antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles using E. coli bacteria.

These are an emerging cheaper alternative to lithium-ion batteries for uses where compact size is not crucial, such as on solar and wind farms. The study was published in Batteries.\"We thought, wouldn't it be fun to take something as nasty and objectionable as hogweed and make something useful out of it,\" study co-author Zoya Bobyleva of Lomonosov Moscow State University commented. \"The thing about hard carbon materials, used in sodium-ion battery anodes, is you can make them from biomass of virtually any origin. No one has considered hogweed before. But it turned out pretty well.\"Sosnowsky's hogweed is an invasive plant that causes severe skin burns. Originally imported to central Russia from Caucasus as an experimental forage crop, it quickly got out of control and, according to forecasts by Skoltech researchers, is threatening to spread over the entire European part of the country by the mid-21st century.Sodium-ion batteries are an alternative technology for power storage that avoids using lithium, which is largely concentrated in a select few countries, is becoming increasingly expensive, and is not environmentally friendly in production. If a battery uses sodium ions instead of lithium ions, however, completely different materials have to be used in the cathode and anode. Not long ago, Skoltech researchers proposed a cathode material with outstanding properties. This time, another research group based at the Institute and MSU, came up with a high-quality anode material derived from a fairly unlikely source.\"As of today, hard carbon offers the best combination of properties for a sodium-ion battery anode. It's an amorphous form of carbon that does not transform into graphite even when exposed to very high temperatures. Unlike graphite, its structure can accommodate sodium ions and release them over many cycles, which is crucial for battery operation, and it does not significantly expand in size upon charge-up. It is also cheap, reasonably easy to synthesize and dispose of, and does not create significant fire hazards. The two key figures of merit here are Coulombic efficiency and energy storage capacity,\" the study's principal investigator, Professor Evgeny Antipov of Skoltech and MSU, said.The hard carbon produced by the MSU-Skoltech team exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which is on par with the best reported results for hard carbons synthesized from other raw materials. That characteristic reflects how well a material stores energy without wasting it on unwanted irreversible secondary processes that actually harm the battery. As for the energy storage capacity, at about 260 mAh/g, the material falls short of the best results reported elsewhere—around 300 mAh/g—but is still reasonably good.\"In fact, we considered both winter hogweed, which is safe for harvesting, and the nasty summer hogweed in full bloom. Hate to tell you, but the specimens gathered in the summer proved better in terms of the Coulombic efficiency of the end product, which is the characteristic we emphasized in this study, because it tends to be the weak spot of hard carbon anodes. As for the energy storage capacity, there are ways we can probably improve it later on,\" Bobyleva added.The team tested three popular approaches to hard carbon synthesis. First, there's direct carbonization: heating the biomass to 1,300 degrees Celsius in an atmosphere without oxygen. Alternatively, you can treat the biomass with an acid to remove metallic and other impurities prior to carbonization. This approach resulted in a significantly higher Coulombic efficiency. Or you can boil the hogweed biomass in water in a closed reactor—this produces very small carbon-containing spheres. While all three approaches led to comparable energy storage capacity, heat treatment with prior impurity removal resulted in the best Coulombic efficiency.\"The demand for rechargeable accumulators will continue to grow. And when it comes to stationary batteries deployed at industrial facilities and in the production of renewable energy to even out fluctuations in available sunlight or wind power, the sodium-ion technology appears very promising. These batteries will be much cheaper, and while they might be heavier and bulkier, it won't be much of a problem for the relevant applications,\" study co-author Professor Artem Abakumov said; he heads the Center for Energy Science and Technology at Skoltech.", "abstract": "近日，俄罗斯斯科尔科沃科技学院的研究人员实现了将有毒杂草转化为钠离子电池的阳极材料。在研究中，研究人员发现用名为Sosnowsky的杂草生产出来的硬碳能够表现出87%的库仑效率，这与从其他原料合成的硬碳的最佳结果持平。这一特性反映了该材料具有强大的储存能量的能力，其储能能力约260毫安时/克。这种硬碳为钠离子电池的阳极提供了最佳的性能组合，它的结构可以容纳钠离子并在多次循环中释放它们，而且它在充电时不会明显膨胀，这些都有利于电池的运行。这项研究开发了一种全新的锂离子电池阳极的廉价替代品，它适用于一些不要求体积的场合，如太阳能和风力发电场。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-scientists-toxic-hogweed-anode-material.html"}, {"title": "美国发布风险管理框架旨在提高人工智能安全可信度", "keyword": "人工智能风险管理框架 人工智能系统 人工智能技术", "content_zh": "NIST风险管理框架旨在提高人工智能的可信度。《指南》寻求培养对人工智能技术的信任，促进人工智能创新，同时减轻风险。华盛顿--美国商务部国家标准和技术研究所(NIST)发布了人工智能风险管理框架（AI RMF 1.0)，这是一份指导文件，供设计、开发、部署或使用人工智能系统的组织自愿使用，以帮助管理人工智能技术的许多风险。 AI RMF遵循国会对NIST制定框架的指示，是与私营和公共部门密切合作制定的。 随着技术的继续发展，它旨在适应人工智能领域，并被组织以不同程度和不同能力使用，以便社会能够从人工智能技术中受益，同时免受其潜在危害。商务部副部长唐·格雷夫斯（Don Graves）表示：“这一自愿框架将有助于开发和部署人工智能技术，使美国、其他国家和组织能够提高人工智能的可信度，同时基于我们的民主价值观管理风险。” “它应该加快人工智能创新和增长，同时推进--而不是限制或损害--所有人的公民权利、公民自由和公平。”与传统软件相比，人工智能带来了许多不同的风险。 人工智能系统是根据数据进行训练的，这些数据可能会随着时间的推移而变化，有时会显著地和意外地变化，以难以理解的方式影响系统。 这些系统在本质上也是“社会技术”的，这意味着它们受到社会动态和人类行为的影响。 人工智能风险可能来自这些技术和社会因素的复杂相互作用，影响人们的生活，从他们使用在线聊天机器人的经历到工作和贷款申请的结果。 该框架使组织能够以不同的方式思考AI和风险。 它促进了机构文化的变革，鼓励组织以新的视角对待人工智能--包括如何思考、交流、衡量和监测人工智能风险及其潜在的积极和消极影响。 AI RMF提供了一个灵活的、结构化的和可测量的过程，使组织能够解决AI风险。 遵循这一管理人工智能风险的过程可以最大限度地发挥人工智能技术的好处，同时减少对个人、团体、社区、组织和社会产生负面影响的可能性。标准和技术部副部长兼NIST主任劳里·E·洛卡西奥（Laurie E.Locascio）表示，该框架是NIST培养对人工智能技术信任的更大努力的一部分--如果这项技术要被社会广泛接受，这是必要的。 Locascio说：“人工智能风险管理框架可以帮助任何行业和任何规模的公司和其他组织启动或加强他们的人工智能风险管理方法。” “它提供了一种新的方式来整合负责任的实践和可操作的指导，以操作可信和负责任的人工智能。 我们期望人工智能RMF有助于推动最佳实践和标准的发展。“人工智能RMF分为两个部分。 第一部分讨论了组织如何构建与人工智能相关的风险，并概述了值得信赖的人工智能系统的特征。 第二部分是框架的核心，描述了治理、地图、度量和管理四个具体功能，以帮助组织解决人工智能系统在实践中的风险。 这些功能可以应用于特定于上下文的用例和AI生命周期的任何阶段。NIST与私营和公共部门密切合作，已经开发AI RMF 18个月了。 该文件反映了NIST从240多个不同组织收到的关于框架草案版本的大约400组正式评论。 NIST今天发布了一些已经承诺使用或推广该框架的组织的声明。该机构今天还发布了一个附带的自愿AI RMF剧本，其中建议了导航和使用该框架的方法。 NIST计划与人工智能社区合作，定期更新该框架，并欢迎随时为Playbook的添加和改进提出建议。 2023年2月底前收到的评论将被纳入2023年春季发布的Playbook更新版本。此外，NIST计划推出一个值得信赖和负责任的AI资源中心，以帮助组织将AI RMF 1.0付诸实践。 工程处鼓励各组织制定和分享如何在其具体情况下使用该系统的简介。 提交的材料可以发送到aiframework@nist.gov.nist致力于继续与公司、民间社会、政府机构、大学和其他方面合作，以制定额外的指导意见。 该机构今天发布了这项工作的路线图。该框架是 ", "content_en": "NIST Risk Management Framework Aims to Improve Trustworthiness of Artificial IntelligenceNew guidance seeks to cultivate trust in AI technologies and promote AI innovation while mitigating risk.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released its Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0), a guidance document for voluntary use by organizations designing, developing, deploying or using AI systems to help manage the many risks of AI technologies. The AI RMF follows a direction from Congress for NIST to develop the framework and was produced in close collaboration with the private and public sectors. It is intended to adapt to the AI landscape as technologies continue to develop, and to be used by organizations in varying degrees and capacities so that society can benefit from AI technologies while also being protected from its potential harms.“This voluntary framework will help develop and deploy AI technologies in ways that enable the United States, other nations and organizations to enhance AI trustworthiness while managing risks based on our democratic values,” said Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves. “It should accelerate AI innovation and growth while advancing — rather than restricting or damaging — civil rights, civil liberties and equity for all.” Compared with traditional software, AI poses a number of different risks. AI systems are trained on data that can change over time, sometimes significantly and unexpectedly, affecting the systems in ways that can be difficult to understand. These systems are also “socio-technical” in nature, meaning they are influenced by societal dynamics and human behavior. AI risks can emerge from the complex interplay of these technical and societal factors, affecting people’s lives in situations ranging from their experiences with online chatbots to the results of job and loan applications. The framework equips organizations to think about AI and risk differently. It promotes a change in institutional culture, encouraging organizations to approach AI with a new perspective — including how to think about, communicate, measure and monitor AI risks and its potential positive and negative impacts. The AI RMF provides a flexible, structured and measurable process that will enable organizations to address AI risks. Following this process for managing AI risks can maximize the benefits of AI technologies while reducing the likelihood of negative impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations and society.The framework is part of NIST’s larger effort to cultivate trust in AI technologies — necessary if the technology is to be accepted widely by society, according to Under Secretary for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio. “The AI Risk Management Framework can help companies and other organizations in any sector and any size to jump-start or enhance their AI risk management approaches,” Locascio said. “It offers a new way to integrate responsible practices and actionable guidance to operationalize trustworthy and responsible AI. We expect the AI RMF to help drive development of best practices and standards.”The AI RMF is divided into two parts. The first part discusses how organizations can frame the risks related to AI and outlines the characteristics of trustworthy AI systems. The second part, the core of the framework, describes four specific functions — govern, map, measure and manage — to help organizations address the risks of AI systems in practice. These functions can be applied in context-specific use cases and at any stages of the AI life cycle.Working closely with the private and public sectors, NIST has been developing the AI RMF for 18 months. The document reflects about 400 sets of formal comments NIST received from more than 240 different organizations on draft versions of the framework. NIST today released statements from some of the organizations that have already committed to use or promote the framework.The agency also today released a companion voluntary AI RMF Playbook, which suggests ways to navigate and use the framework. NIST plans to work with the AI community to update the framework periodically and welcomes suggestions for additions and improvements to the playbook at any time. Comments received by the end of February 2023 will be included in an updated version of the playbook to be released in spring 2023.In addition, NIST plans to launch a Trustworthy and Responsible AI Resource Center to help organizations put the AI RMF 1.0 into practice. The agency encourages organizations to develop and share profiles of how they would put it to use in their specific contexts. Submissions may be sent to AIFramework@nist.gov.NIST is committed to continuing its work with companies, civil society, government agencies, universities and others to develop additional guidance. The agency today issued a roadmap for that work.The framework is part of NIST’s broad and growing portfolio of AI-related work that includes fundamental and applied research along with a focus on measurement and evaluation, technical standards, and contributions to AI policy.

Osaka Metropolitan University scientists made a significant advance toward self-charging wearable devices with their invention of a dynamic magnifier-enhanced piezoelectric vibration energy harvester that can amplify power generated from impulsive vibrations, such as from a human walking, by about 90 times, while remaining as small as currently developed energy harvesters. The results were published in Applied Physics Letters.These days, people carry multiple electronic devices such as smartphones, and wearable devices are expected to become increasingly widespread in the near future. The resulting demand for more efficient recharging of these devices has increased the attention paid to energy harvesting, a technology that converts energy such as heat and light into electricity that can power small devices. One form of energy harvesting called vibration energy harvesting is deemed highly practical given that it can transform the kinetic energy from vibration into electricity and is not affected by weather or climate.A research team led by Associate Professor Takeshi Yoshimura from the Graduate School of Engineering at Osaka Metropolitan University has developed a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) piezoelectric vibration energy harvester that is only approximately 2 cm in diameter with a U-shaped metal component called a dynamic magnifier. Compared with conventional harvesters, the new harvester allows for an increase of about 90 times in the power converted from impulsive vibrations, which can be generated by the human walking motion.The team has been working on developing vibration energy harvesters that utilize the piezoelectric effect, a phenomenon in which specific types of materials produce an electric charge or voltage in response to applied pressure. So far, they have succeeded in generating microwatt-level electricity from mechanical vibrations with a constant frequency, such as those generated by motors and washing machines. However, the power generation of these harvesters drops drastically when the applied vibrations are nonstationary and impulsive, such as those generated by human walking.Responding to this challenge, the team developed and incorporated the U-shaped vibration amplification component under the harvester. The component allowed for improvement in power generation without increasing the device size. The technology is expected to generate electric power from non-steady vibrations, including walking motion, in order to power small wearable devices such as smartphones and wireless earphones.Professor Yoshimura concluded, \"Since electronic devices are expected to become more energy-efficient, we hope that this invention will contribute to the realization of self-charging wearable devices.\"", "abstract": "近日，日本大阪城市大学的研究人员为可穿戴设备开发了一种新型能量采集器。该团队利用压电效应来实现设备能量的采集，到目前为止，他们已经成功地通过恒定频率的机械振动产生了微瓦级的电力。并且为了应对非平稳或者是脉冲震动时，能量采集器的发电量急剧下降的情况，还开发了一种被称为动态放大器的U形金属组件，该组件允许在不增加设备尺寸的情况下提高发电效率。他们开发的微机电系统压电振动能量采集器的直径仅约2厘米，与传统能量采集器相比这种新型能量采集器可以将脉冲振动(如人类行走)产生的功率放大约90倍。该技术有望利用非稳态振动来为智能手机和无线耳机等小型可穿戴设备供电。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-high-performance-compact-vibration-energy-harvester.html"}, {"title": "德国实现了优化多层有机太阳能电池的性能和稳定性", "keyword": "低聚物 半导体层 有机太阳能电池 特定分子衍生物 ", "content_zh": "研究人员优化了多层有机太阳能电池的性能和稳定性。由低聚物制成的受体层可以提高有机太阳能电池的性能，同时保证长的工作寿命。 这是由弗里德里希-亚历山大-大学部的材料科学家进行的一系列复杂实验室实验的结果。 有机太阳能电池比传统的硅模块制造起来不那么复杂，而且由于它们可以灵活和透明而具有更多的通用性。 研究人员的发现发表在《自然·能源》杂志上。乌克兰战争继续鲜明地提醒我们，尽快停止对化石燃料的依赖是多么重要。 再生能源的迅速扩展是这方面成功的关键之一。 以光伏发电为例，困难不仅涉及提高产量的斗争，还涉及新应用的开发，因为在人口稠密的工业国家，如德国，太阳能电池板可用的表面积有限。这就是为什么目前对有机光伏发电进行了如此多的研究。 与传统系统中使用的硅不同，有机太阳能电池由碳基半导体组成，它们从溶液中直接应用到支撑膜上。 这意味着这些模块是灵活的，可以是半透明的或完全透明的，这在城市空间开辟了广泛的潜在应用，包括在窗格中的使用。两个世界中最好的选择半导体层的最佳材料对研究人员来说是一个重大挑战：“例如，如果我们使用具有非常长分子链的聚合物，这些模块对温度波动的抵御能力很强，使用寿命更长，”克里斯托夫·布拉贝克教授博士说， FAU材料科学（电子材料和能源技术）主席，埃尔兰根-纽伦堡可再生能源亥姆霍兹研究所所长。 “然而，聚合物的定义不是很好，由于其复杂性，有更多的缺陷，这可能导致在微光水平下输出更低。”为了寻找电子转移的替代品，因此HIERN的研究活动正在加强，对被称为低聚物的分子进行研究。 它们的链比聚合物链更短，设计更精确，在近红外光下具有更高的效率。 缺点是低聚物对温度波动更敏感，而且通常更不稳定。由克里斯托弗·布拉贝克领导的国际工作组旨在通过开发低分子非富勒烯半导体来结合这两个世界的精华，这些半导体既有高产量，又坚固耐用。 他们将目光投向了一种名为Y6的特殊分子的衍生物，该分子具有对称结构，由碳以及氮、氢、氧、硫和溴原子组成。“我们在无数次测试中修饰了该分子，并检查了它作为受体层的性质，”在FAU进行实验的博士生张迪飞解释说。在调查期间，华南理工大学的研究人员也参与了调查， 利用二维广角X射线散射测量分析了分子链的微观结构和行为，最终获胜者是OY3，分子结构的复杂微调最终产生了一个有希望的候选--缩写为OY3的低聚物。 Brabec说：“OY3的平均性能效率为15%，我们也用其他一些衍生工具测量了这个值。” “然而，给我们留下深刻印象的是它出色的光稳定性。”即使在200小时的操作后，低聚物仍保持了最初产量的94%。 进一步的测量显示，运行寿命超过25000小时，平均每年运行1500小时，相当于16年以上的运行寿命。布拉贝克说，“这些参数对于多层有机光伏组件来说是独特的，满足了快速商业化的所有要求。我们的目标低聚物设计策略将有机光伏提高到了一个新的效率水平，并使其非常接近实际应用。” ", "content_en": "Researchers optimize performance and stability of multi-layer organic solar cellsAcceptor layers made of oligomers can increase the performance of organic solar cells and ensure a long operating life at the same time. This is the result of a series of complex laboratory experiments conducted by materials scientists at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit?t Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). Organic solar cells are less complex to manufacture than conventional silicon modules and are considerably more versatile as they can be flexible and transparent. The researchers' findings have been published in the journal Nature Energy.The war in Ukraine continues to serve as a stark reminder of how important it is for us to cease our dependency on fossil fuels as quickly as possible. The rapid expansion of regenerative energy sources is one of the keys to success in this respect. In the case of photovoltaics, for example, the difficulties not only involve the struggle for higher output, but also the development of new applications as the surface area available for solar panels is limited in densely-populated industrial nations such as Germany.This is the reason why so much research is currently being carried out on organic photovoltaics. In contrast to the silicon used in conventional systems, organic solar cells consist of carbon-based semi-conductors that are directly applied from a solution onto a supporting film. This means the modules are flexible and can be translucent or completely transparent, which opens up a wide range of potential applications in urban spaces, including use in window panes.The best of both worldsSelecting the best material for the semiconductor layers is a significant challenge for researchers: \"For example, if we use polymers with very long chains of molecules, the modules are robust against fluctuations in temperature and have a longer operating life,\" says Prof. Dr. Christoph Brabec, Chair of Materials Science (Materials in Electronics and Energy Technology) at FAU and Director of the Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg for Renewable Energy (HI ERN). \"However, polymers are not very well defined and have more defects due to their complexity, which can lead to lower output in low light levels.\"In the search for alternatives to electron transfer, research activities at HI ERN are therefore being stepped up with research into molecules known as oligomers. Their chains are shorter, they can be designed more precisely and they have a higher efficiency in near-infrared light than polymer chains. The disadvantage is that oligomers are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations and are generally more instable.The international working group led by Christoph Brabec aims to combine the best from both worlds by developing low-molecule non-fullerene semiconductors that have a high output while being robust and durable at the same time.

Further measurements showed an operating life of more than 25,000 hours, which, with an average operation of 1,500 hours per year, is equivalent to an operating life of more than 16 years.Brabec says, \"These parameters are unique for multi-layer organic photovoltaic modules and fulfill all requirements for rapid commercialization.

The work was published Nano Letters.AlScN has the advantage that it can be deposited at temperatures low enough to be compatible with silicon foundries. “Most ferroelectric materials require much higher temperatures. AlScN's special properties mean our demonstrated memory devices can go on top of the silicon layer in a vertical hetero-integrated stack,\" said researcher Troy Olson.In 2021, the team established the viability of the AlScN as a compute-in-memory powerhouse. Its capacity for miniaturisation, low cost, resource efficiency, ease of manufacture and commercial feasibility demonstrated serious strides in the eyes of research and industry.In the most recent study , the team observed that their CIM ferrodiode may be able to perform up to 100 times faster than a conventional computing architecture.Other research in the field has successfully used compute-in-memory architectures to improve performance for AI applications. However, these solutions have been limited, unable to overcome the conflicting trade-off between performance and flexibility. Computing architecture using memristor crossbar arrays, a design that mimics the structure of the human brain to support high-level performance in neural network operations, has also demonstrated admirable speeds.Yet neural network operations, which use layers of algorithms to interpret data and recognize patterns, are only one of several key categories of data tasks necessary for functional AI. The design is not adaptable enough to offer adequate performance on any other AI data operations.The Penn team says their ferrodiode design offers groundbreaking flexibility that other compute-in-memory architectures do not. It achieves superior accuracy, performing equally well in not one but three essential data operations that form the foundation of effective AI applications. It supports on-chip storage, or the capacity to hold the enormous amounts of data required for deep learning, parallel search, a function that allows for accurate data filtering and analysis, and matrix multiplication acceleration, the core process of neural network computing.“It is important to realize that all of the AI computing that is currently done is software-enabled on a silicon hardware architecture designed decades ago,” says Deep Jariwala, who co-led the project. “This is why artificial intelligence as a field has been dominated by computer and software engineers.

From long-range communication over the internet to high-speed information transfer within data centers and stock exchanges, optical fiber remains critical in our globalized world.Fiber networks are not, however, structurally perfect, and information transfer can be compromised when things go wrong. To address this problem, physicists at the University of Bath in the UK have developed a new kind of fiber designed to enhance the robustness of networks. This robustness could prove to be especially important in the coming age of quantum networks.The team has fabricated optical fibers (the flexible glass channels through which information is sent) that can protect light (the medium through which data is transmitted) using the mathematics of topology. Best of all, these modified fibers are easily scalable, meaning the structure of each fiber can be preserved over thousands of kilometers.The Bath study is published in the latest issue of Science Advances.Protecting light against disorderAt its simplest, optical fiber, which typically has a diameter of 125 ?m (similar to a thick strand of hair) comprises a core of solid glass surrounded by cladding. Light travels through the core, where it bounces along as though reflecting off a mirror.However, the pathway taken by an optical fiber as it crisscrosses the landscape is rarely straight and undisturbed: turns, loops, and bends are the norm. Distortions in the fiber can cause information to degrade as it moves between sender and receiver. \"The challenge was to build a network that takes robustness into account,\" said Physics Ph.D. student Nathan Roberts, who led the research.\"Whenever you fabricate a fiber-optic cable, small variations in the physical structure of the fiber are inevitably present. When deployed in a network, the fiber can also get twisted and bent. One way to counter these variations and defects is to ensure the fiber design process includes a real focus on robustness. This is where we found the ideas of topology useful.\"To design this new fiber, the Bath team used topology, which is the mathematical study of quantities that remain unchanged despite continuous distortions to the geometry. Its principles are already applied to many areas of physics research. By connecting physical phenomena to unchanging numbers, the destructive effects of a disordered environment can be avoided.The fiber designed by the Bath team deploys topological ideas by including several light-guiding cores in a fiber, linked together in a spiral. Light can hop between these cores but becomes trapped within the edge thanks to the topological design. These edge states are protected against disorder in the structure.Bath physicist Dr. Anton Souslov, who co-authored the study as theory lead, said, \"Using our fiber, light is less influenced by environmental disorder than it would be in an equivalent system lacking topological design.\"By adopting optical fibers with topological design, researchers will have the tools to pre-empt and forestall signal-degrading effects by building inherently robust photonic systems.\"Theory meets practical expertiseBath physicist Dr. Peter Mosley, who co-authored the study as experimental lead, said, \"Previously, scientists have applied the complex mathematics of topology to light, but here at the University of Bath we have lots of experience physically making optical fibers, so we put the mathematics together with our expertise to create topological fiber.\"The team, which also includes Ph.D. student Guido Baardink and Dr. Josh Nunn from the Department of Physics, are now looking for industry partners to develop their concept further.\"We are really keen to help people build robust communication networks and we are ready for the next phase of this work,\" said Dr. Souslov.Mr. Roberts added, \"We have shown that you can make kilometers of topological fiber wound around a spool. We envision a quantum internet where information will be transmitted robustly across continents using topological principles.\"He also pointed out that this research has implications that go beyond communications networks. He said, \"Fiber development is not only a technological challenge, but also an exciting scientific field in its own right.\"Understanding how to engineer optical fiber has led to light sources from bright 'supercontinuum' that spans the entire visible spectrum right down to quantum light sources that produce individual photons—single particles of light.\"The future is quantumQuantum networks are widely expected to play an important technological role in years to come. Quantum technologies have the capacity to store and process information in more powerful ways than 'classical' computers can today, as well as sending messages securely across global networks without any chance of eavesdropping.But the quantum states of light that transmit information are easily impacted by their environment and finding a way to protect them is a major challenge.

But when they dwelled on this, they concluded that this could be expected. The reasoning is that from a materials perspective, AlGaN may be quite defect tolerant, due to its short diffusion length; the results of visible microLEDs produced by Yao's colleagues at UCSB show that they have an effective sidewall passivation technology; and it is well known that shrinking the dimensions of the devices should increase the likelihood that light can escape from this chip.Yao and co-workers produced a range of deep-UV microLEDs by taking AlN-on-sapphire templates, loading them into an MOCVD reactor, and depositing heterostructures that feature four 1.5 nm-thick quantum wells, a 5 nm-thick magnesium-doped electron-blocking layer and a 40 nm-thick short period superlattice. Square microLEDs with sides either 300 ?m, 80 ?m, 40 ?m or 20 ?m in length were produced by using reactive ion etching to create mesas. These devices are equipped with a semi-reflective p-type contact and a 50 nm-thick SiO2 passivation layer, added by atomic-layer deposition.Measurements on a subset of microLEDs emitting at 277 nm show that increasing the mesa width from 20 ?m to 300 ?m results in an increase in forward voltage from 7.6 V to 9.1 V. This is attributed to improved current spreading in the n-AlGaN layer - although there is also a small effect due to increased current leakage.Additional studies on deep-UV LEDs with emission wavelengths of 291 nm and 304 nm, realised by adjusting the AlGaN composition in the quantum wells, followed the trend of smaller devices delivering a higher external quantum efficiency at the drive current of 20 A cm-2.The 304 nm microLED with a side of 20 ?m produced the highest peak external quantum efficiency within the study, hitting 4 percent during on-wafer measurements. The picture above shows a scanning electron microscopy image of a deep-UV LED produced by UCSB that has dimensions of 20 ?m by 20 ?m.Since reporting these results, the team has realised an external quantum efficiencies of around 5 percent on bare chips with similar structures, produced using a similar fabrication process. Hitting 5 percent is significant, as it is as high as the best commercial deep-UV LEDs, according to Yao. “But all of them are fully packaged, thin-film flip-chip bonded and transparently encapsulated on a reflective header, which we currently lack the expertise in.”Based on conversations with UV LED vendors, the team expects that the introduction of full packaging will roughly double the output power of their devices.As well as reporting their better, more recent bare-wafer results, the team plans to incorporate additional structures into their deep-UV emitters, such as array of microLEDs with common contact. This will enable devices to combine a high external quantum efficiency with a high absolute power.", "abstract": "近日，由美国加州大学圣巴巴拉分校（UCSB）领导的研究团队研发出一种效率更高的深紫外微型发光二极管（LED），有可能为汞灯提供一种更环保的替代品，用于灭活所有已知微生物和病毒病原体，如新冠病毒和非典病毒等。与之前进行的深紫外微型LED研究相比，新研究考虑了更广泛的波长范围和尺寸，并观测到截至目前最高的外部量子效率值。研究团队利用蓝宝石上氮化铝为衬底，在MOCVD反应器中沉积异质结构，制备出一系列深紫外微型LED，并通过使用反应离子蚀刻产生台面而制成最终的器件。这些LED器件还通过原子层沉积，制备出半反射p型接触和50纳米厚的二氧化硅钝化层。该研究为研发新型深紫外微型LED提供了新的技术方案，推动了发光二极管领域的发展。", "link": "https://compoundsemiconductor.net/article/115262/Deep_UV_microLEDs_Scaling_boosts_efficiency"}, {"title": "美国开发出一种可保持性能的全橡胶可拉伸二极管", "keyword": "全橡胶可拉伸二极管 弹性橡胶材料 二极管", "content_zh": "可伸缩橡胶二极管为医疗、电子设备打开了可能性。如果你在电脑或手机上阅读这篇文章，这在一定程度上要归功于二极管。 二极管--通常是刚性的电气元件，容易在一个方向上传导电流--用于各种关键的电子功能，从将交流转换成直流，从机械能量转换成电能，到用作开关元件以实现数字显示等。 随着技术的进步，机器人或医疗设备等电子设备变得更加灵活，因此宾夕法尼亚州立大学的研究人员开发了一种保持性能的完全橡胶可拉伸二极管。该团队在《科学进展》上发表了他们的结果。“这种二极管都是由弹性橡胶材料制成的--橡胶材料策略是关键，”相应的作者、工程科学和力学多萝西·奎格尔职业发展副教授、生物医学工程和材料科学和工程副教授于存江说。 他的团队以前开发过其他橡胶电子材料，如晶体管。 “通过制造橡胶二极管，我们丰富了橡胶电子产品的库，这样我们就可以更接近于完全用橡胶材料制造集成电路和系统。”Yu说，更灵活的器件可以表现得更像生物组织，从而实现更好的生物集成器件。 一个例子是可以植入心脏的软贴片装置。“心脏跳动会产生电信号，”他说。 “通过橡胶二极管，一个设备可以在体内将交流转换为直流，这是目前不可能的。”俞说，为了在机械拉伸的同时实现这样的电气性能，研究人员合理地考虑了设备的架构、垂直结构和布局。 除了为更灵活的医疗设备带来好处之外，这一发展还对这些医疗设备中的电源管理系统产生了自我可持续系统的影响。“从收割机中回收的能量在储存使用之前总是需要进行校正--这在许多新兴领域都很重要，”余说。余举了一个发光运动鞋的日常例子，它包含一个压电能量收割机，将机械能转化为电能，以点亮发光二极管。 一个整流电路将收集到的交流电转换成有用的直流电。“研究人员和工业界正在使用传统的二极管，但他们想要一些可以延伸的东西，就像我们在论文中报道的那样，”他说。 “这种橡胶二极管开辟了许多可能性。”余说，下一步包括进一步优化二极管，并将其集成到更复杂的系统中。“我们希望改善二极管的结构和性能，即使在非常大的机械拉伸或变形范围下，也能实现不受干扰的操作，”他说。 “我们希望使用这些二极管来满足各种新兴应用中的关键设备需求，如机器人和生物医学设备。” ", "content_en": "Stretchable rubber diode opens possibilities for medical, electronic devicesIf you are reading this article on your computer or phone, it is in part thanks to diodes.

SkyWater Technology’s existing 130nm CMOS S130 process flow made them ideal partners.“We were fortunate to have ReRAM experience at SkyWater through our DARPA 3DSoC project, and so were well familiar with the processing needs and challenges of the technology,” Kosier told All About Circuits in an email.SkyWater Technology is not only fabricating the chips but working with Weebit Nano to fully integrate their chips into sub-modules and deliver them to potential customers to demo. Additionally, SkyWater Technology may scale the chips to a 90nm carbon nanotube CMOS process in the future.“We engaged with Weebit to do the technology transfer and integration and support the rollout of the technology to our broad customer base,” said Kosier.Many innovative types of memory require new and specialized methods or equipment to fabricate, limiting the ability to mass produce. Weebit Nano intentionally selects the most common materials and designs that can be supported by readily-available fabrication equipment to lower the barriers to production.The Promise of ReRAMWeebit Nano highlights some key advantages of ReRAM NVM, including improved endurance, robustness to its environment, low power consumption, and high speed.In terms of endurance, the company claims that ReRAM experiences a 10–100x improvement in endurance over traditional flash, with ReRAM withstanding up to one million write cycles compared to 10,000 program/erase cycles in traditional flash. Additionally, access time is claimed to be 100x faster compared to flash memory. Data logging is one application where ReRAM can benefit from these characteristics.ReRAM is also robust against its environment, including high temperatures and radiation. Weebit Nano claims that data can be stored for up to 10 years at 175°C or 20 years at 125°C. It is also reported to be 350x more resistant to radiation than flash memory. This makes the device a potential candidate for use in aerospace applications.ReRAM is also reported to be more power efficient than embedded flash memory and can be incorporated using backend-of-line (BEOL) manufacturing, increasing integration flexibility. Once again, this is an advantage over flash memory, which uses frontend-of-line manufacturing.Weebit Nano also claims ReRAM has potential applications in neuromorphic computing since ReRAM can act as a computing device as well. The company has partnered with CEA-Leti in the past to demonstrate how ReRAM can be used in spiking neural networks.What’s Next for the CollabAfter the demo chips are qualified in early 2023, Weebit Nano and SkyWater Technology will work on IP blocks that can be used by future customers and partners in their designs.“The IP blocks of different array sizes are under development.

Recent work from the groups of engineer James Hone at Columbia and theoretical physicist Shaffique Adam at the National University of Singapore and Yale-NUS builds new understanding of this unusual hydrodynamic behavior that changes some old assumptions about the physics of metals. The study was published on April 15 in the journal Science Advances. In the work, the team studied the behavior of a novel semiconductor in which negatively charged electrons and positively charged \"holes\" simultaneously carry current. They found that this current can be described with just two \"hydrodynamic\" equations: one describing how the electrons and holes slide against each other, and a second for how all of the charges move together through the atomic lattice of the material.\"Simple formulas usually mean simple physics,\" Hone said, who was astonished when Adam's postdoc, Derek Ho, built the new model, which challenges assumptions many physicists learn about metals early in their education. \"We were all taught that in a normal metal, all you really need to know is how an electron bounces off various types of imperfections,\" Hone said. \"In this system, the basic models we learned about in our first courses just don't apply.\"In metal wires carrying an electrical current, there are many moving electrons that largely ignore each other, like riders on a crowded subway. As the electrons move, they inevitably run into either physical defects in the material carrying them or vibrations that cause them to scatter. Current slows down, and energy is lost. But, in materials that have smaller numbers of electrons, those electrons actually interact strongly with each other and will flow together, like water through a pipe. They still encounter those same imperfections, but their behavior is completely different: instead of thinking about individual electrons randomly scattering, you now have to treat the entire set of electrons (and holes) together, Hone said.To experimentally test their simple new model of hydrodynamic conductivity, the team studied bilayer graphene—a material made from two atom-thin sheets of carbon. Hone's Ph.D. student Cheng Tan measured electrical conductivity from room temperature down to near absolute zero as he varied the density of electrons and holes. Tan and Ho found an excellent match between the model and their results. \"It's striking that experimental data agrees so much better with hydrodynamic theory than old \"standard theory\" about conductivity,\" Ho said.The model worked when the material was tuned in a way that allows conductivity to be turned on and off, and the hydrodynamic behavior was prominent even at room temperature. \"It is really remarkable that bilayer graphene has been studied for over 15 years, but until now we did not correctly understand its room-temperature conductivity,\" said Hone, who is also Wang Fong-Jen Professor and chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia Engineering.Low-resistance, room-temperature conductivity could have very practical applications. Existing superconducting materials, which conduct electricity without resistance, need to be kept incredibly cold. Materials capable of hydrodynamic flow could help researchers build more efficient electronic devices—known as viscous electronics—that don't require such intense and expensive cooling.On a more fundamental level, the team verified that the sliding motion between electrons and holes isn't specific to graphene, said Adam, associate professor from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the National University of Singapore and the Division of Science at Yale-NUS College. Because this relative motion is universal, researchers should be able to find it in other materials—especially as improving fabrication techniques continues to yield cleaner and cleaner samples, which the Hone Lab has focused on developing over the past decade. In the future, researchers might also design specific geometries to further improve performance of devices built to take advantage of this unique water-like collective behavior.", "abstract": "近日，由美国哥伦比亚大学和新加坡国立大学共同领导的研究团队研发出一种能够携带电流的新型流体动力学半导体，并对其载流子输运行为进行了深入研究，形成了与金属物理学领域以往的一些旧假设不同的全新认识和理解。研究人员通过建立新模型来研究这种半导体的载流子输运行为，其中带负电的电子和带正电的“空穴”同时携带电流。这种电流可以用两个“流体动力学”方程来描述。这些简单的公式通常意味着简单的物理学，但该模型挑战了许多物理学家在早期教育中学习到的金属学假设。为了实验测试新模型，该团队研究了双层石墨烯，这是一种由两个原子厚的碳片制成的材料。研究人员通过改变电子和空穴的密度，测量了材料从室温到接近绝对零度的电导率。最后，研究人员发现该模型与实验结果非常匹配，而且实验数据与流体动力学理论的一致性比关于电导率的旧“标准理论”还要好得多。该研究为研发更高效的电子设备提供了技术支持，推动了石墨烯应用技术领域的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-07-explore-hydrodynamic-semiconductor-electrons.html"}, {"title": "新加坡开发出可以弥合处理器和内存之间差距的新型可重构设备", "keyword": "相变材料可重构移位寄存器内存架构 脉冲 电阻", "content_zh": "研究人员开发一种新型的可重构设备来弥合处理器和存储器之间的鸿沟。开发高能效的高性能计算设备（即不仅耗电少，而且计算速度快的设备）是边缘计算研究的一个关键目标。 将执行移位寄存器操作的存储组件和单元结合起来是实现这一目标的一种潜在方法。大多数计算设备都由物理上独立的存储组件和处理单元组成。 为了大体上简化这些设备并降低其功耗，开发了一种可以潜在地有效地执行这两种功能的设备--移位寄存器-存储器体系结构。传统的移位寄存器-存储器体系结构有局限性，尽管其中一些体系结构显示了有希望的结果。 这些限制包括使用许多器件以及将电阻转换为电信号的要求。基于相变合金，在玻璃态非晶态和有序晶体态之间可逆切换的材料，新加坡科技与设计大学(SUTD)的研究人员开发了一种新的可重构移位存储器中的寄存器结构。 他们的器件既可以作为可重构存储元件，又可以作为可编程移位寄存器，并在《高级智能系统》上发表了一篇论文。“基于材料(M)状态的移位寄存器”一词被用来描述研究人员开发的移位寄存器存储器件。 利用相变材料的四种状态（即非晶态、全晶态、部分晶态和预晶态）（代表不同的移位寄存器/存储模式）来操作该器件，由于其特殊的设计，器件可以切换到移位寄存器或存储功能，并且易于编程。 研究人员在初步测试中显示，该器件在两种功能上的表现都令人印象深刻。“当作为存储器运行时，该器件可以用1.9ns脉冲从无序的玻璃状态切换到晶体状态，比现有掺氮碲化锗锑层的器件短约三分之一； 并显示出2 PJ的重置能量。 SUTD的助理教授德斯蒙德·洛克（Desmond Loke）是该研究的主要研究员，他说：“当作为移位寄存器工作时，该器件可以用单个单元在串入串出模式和串入并行输出模式之间切换，并表现出许多以前从未表现过的电阻水平。”为了大幅降低功耗，研究小组提出的新移位寄存器存储器架构可以用于设计未来广泛的高性能电子系统。 基于M状态的移位寄存器可以应用于各种操作方案和计算，尽管为了本研究的目的，研究人员已经表明这些器件能够成功地执行移位寄存器操作。 ", "content_en": "Researchers develop a novel reconfigurable device that can bridge the gap between processor and memoryDeveloping energy efficient high performing computing devices (i.e., devices that not only consume little power, but also compute information rapidly) is a key goal of edge computing research. Combining the memory components and units that perform shift register operations is a potential way to achieve this goal.Most computing devices are made up of a physically separate memory component and processing unit. To substantially simplify these devices and reduce its power consumption, a device that can potentially perform both functions efficiently—the shift register-in-memory architecture—has been developed.Conventional shift register-in-memory architectures have limitations, although some of these architectures show promising results. The limitations include the use of many devices and the requirement to convert the electrical resistance to electric signals.Based on phase-change alloys, materials that switch reversibly between the glassy amorphous state and the ordered crystal state, researchers at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) have developed a new reconfigurable shift register-in-memory architecture. Their device works both as a reconfigurable memory component and as a programmable shift register and has been introduced in a paper published in Advanced Intelligent Systems.The term \"material (M) state-based shift register\" was used to describe the shift register-in-memory device developed by the researchers. The four material states (i.e., the amorphous state, fully crystalline state, partially crystallized state and primed state) of the phase-change material (representing different shift register/ memory modes) were used to operate the device.The device can be switched to perform either shift register or memory functions and is easily programmable due to its special design. The researchers showed that the device performed impressively for both functions in preliminary tests.\"When operating as a memory, the device can be switched from the disordered glass state to crystalline state with 1.9 ns pulses, which is about one-third shorter than those of existing devices with germanium antimony telluride layers doped with nitrogen; and exhibit a resetting energy of 2 pJ. When operating as a shift register, the device can be switched between the serial-in–serial-out mode to serial-in–parallel-out mode, with a single cell, and exhibit many resistance levels, which has not been shown before,\" said SUTD's Assistant Professor Desmond Loke, who is the principal investigator of the study.To substantially reduce the power consumption, the new shift register-in-memory architecture proposed by the research team could be used to design a wide range of high-performance electronic systems in the future.

Adrian Buchmann, Claudius Hoberg, Fabio Novelli at Ruhr University Bochum used an ultrashort laser pulse to create a temporary metal-like state in a jet of liquid water. This altered the transmission of terahertz pulses over timescales of just tens of femtoseconds.With the latest semiconductor-based switches approaching fundamental upper limits on how fast they can operate, researchers are on the hunt for faster ways of switching signals. One unexpected place to look for inspiration is the curious behaviour of water under extreme conditions – like those deep within ice-giant planets or created by powerful lasers.Molecular dynamics simulations suggest water enters a metallic state at pressures of 300 GPa and temperatures of 7000 K. While such conditions do not occur on Earth, it is possible that this state contributes to the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. To study this effect closer to home, recent experiments have used powerful, ultra-short laser pulses to trigger photoionization in water-based solutions – creating fleeting, metal-like states.Liquid jetIn their study, the trio in Bochum fired laser pulses at a water-based solution of sodium iodide. The solution was sprayed from a specialized nozzle, which flattened the liquid jet into a micron-thick sheet. When subjected to an intense optical laser pulse that lasted for 50 fs, electrons from the iodide ions become excited into the conduction band of the liquid water. This “pump” pulse makes the water behave like a metal, at least temporarily.While in this metal-like state, the water’s optical properties are temporarily altered. To detect this change Buchmann, Hoberg, and Novelli fired a “probe” pulse of terahertz radiation at the water and measured how much of the probe pulse was transmitted though the water. When the pump and probe pulses overlapped with zero delay, they found that the transmission fell by 20% compared to transmission in the absence of a pump pulse. By increasing the delay between the pump and probe, the team determined that it took just 70 fs for the water to relax from a metal to its normal state.The terahertz probe pulses were about 1 ps long, which is significantly longer than the pump pulse and the relaxation time of the water. This allowed the team to change the shapes of the transmitted probe pulses, shifting the frequencies in the pulses to higher values. The trio says that this frequency-shifting effect could have useful applications in experiments.Looking further into the future, the trio hopes that its research could pave the way for a new field of “water electronics”. With switching time of just 70 fs, water is already twice as fast as the best semiconductor switches, which take about 150 fs to change state.The research is described in APL Photonics.", "abstract": "近日，德国波鸿鲁尔大学研发出一种由激光控制的水基开关，其运行速度是现有半导体开关的两倍。随着最新半导体开关接近其运行速度的理论上限，科学家正寻找更快的信号切换方式。让科学家产生灵感的一个意想不到的现象是水在极端条件下的奇特行为，比如在冰巨行星深处的水，或者通过强大激光作用的水。在新研究中，研究人员向碘化钠水基溶液中发射激光脉冲。溶液从一个专门的喷嘴中喷出，将液体射流展平成微米级厚度的薄片。当受到持续50 飞秒的强激光脉冲作用时，碘离子中的电子被激发到液态水的导带中。这种泵浦脉冲使水表现得像金属一样，此时水的光学特性会暂时改变。为检测这种变化，研究人员向水中发射了一个太赫兹辐射探测脉冲，并测量透过水的探测脉冲数量。当泵浦脉冲和探测脉冲以零延迟重叠时，研究人员发现传输延迟与没有泵浦脉冲时的传输相比下降了20%。通过增加泵和探针之间的间隔时间，研究人员确定水从金属松弛到正常状态只需要70飞秒，该水平是半导体开关的两倍，后者改变状态一般需要150 飞秒。该成果有望为水电子学这一新领域的发展铺平道路。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/water-based-switch-outpaces-semiconductor-devices/"}, {"title": "德国研发出低风险低成本便携式光谱设备", "keyword": "光谱仪 核磁共振 超低场 超级化技术 磁共振传感器", "content_zh": "低风险，低成本：便携式光谱仪可能很快成为真正的核磁共振(NMR)是一种具有广泛应用的分析工具，包括用于医学诊断目的的磁共振成像。 然而，核磁共振往往需要产生强大的磁场，这限制了它的使用范围。 在美因茨约翰内斯·古腾堡大学(JGU)和美因茨亥姆霍兹研究所(HIM)工作的研究人员现在发现了潜在的新方法，可以通过消除对强磁场的需求来减小相应设备的尺寸，并降低可能的相关风险。 这是通过将所谓的零场到超低场核磁共振与一种特殊的超极化技术相结合来实现的。 “这种令人兴奋的新方法基于一种创新的概念。它开辟了一系列机会，克服了以前的缺点，”Danila Barskiy博士说，他是Sofja Kovalevskaja奖的获得者，自2020年以来一直在JGU和他从事相关学科。在没有强磁场的情况下进行测量的新方法。由于磁铁，当前一代核磁共振设备极其沉重和昂贵。 另一个复杂的因素是目前用作冷却剂的液氦的短缺。 巴斯基说：“通过我们的新技术，我们正在逐步将ZULF NMR推向完全无磁体的状态，但我们仍有许多挑战需要克服。”为了在这种情况下使磁体多余，Barskiy提出了将零到超低场核磁共振（ZULF NMR）与一种特殊技术相结合的想法，这种技术使原子核超极化成为可能。 ZULF核磁共振本身是最近发展起来的一种光谱学形式，它提供了丰富的分析结果，而不需要大的磁场。 高场NMR的另一个优势是，在金属等导电材料存在的情况下，它的信号也可以很容易地被检测到。 用于ZULF核磁共振的传感器，通常是光泵磁强计，灵敏度高，易于使用，并且已经在商业上可用。 因此，组装ZULF NMR光谱仪相对简单。Sabre-Relay：像指挥棒一样传递自旋顺序然而，产生的NMR信号是一个需要处理的问题。 迄今为止用于产生信号的方法只适用于对有限选择的化学品进行分析，或者与过高的成本有关。 出于这个原因，巴斯基决定利用超极化技术Sabre，它允许在溶液中排列大量的核自旋。 有许多这样的技术可以产生足以在ZULF条件下检测的信号。 其中有Sabre，即通过可逆交换进行信号放大的简称，它被证明是特别适合的。 SABRE技术的核心是铱金属配合物，它介导自旋序从副氢转移到衬底。 Barskiy通过使用Sabre-Relay（Sabre技术的最新改进），成功地避开了样品与复合物临时结合所带来的缺点。 在这种情况下，Sabre被用来诱导极化，然后被中继到二级底物。物理和化学界面上的自旋化学由于他们发表在《科学进展》上的题为“零场核磁共振的中继超极化”的论文，主要作者埃里克·范·戴克博士和他们的合著者报告了他们如何能够检测从伏特加样品中提取的甲醇和乙醇的信号。“这个简单的例子证明了我们如何能够在廉价、快速、快速的帮助下扩大ZULF核磁共振的应用范围， 和多才多艺的超极化方法，“巴斯基总结道我们希望我们已经设法更接近我们的目标，即开发可用于分析血液和尿液等液体的紧凑型便携式设备，在未来，可能还能识别葡萄糖和氨基酸等特殊化学物质。” ", "content_en": "Less risk, less costs: Portable spectroscopy devices could soon become realNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an analytical tool with a wide range of applications, including the magnetic resonance imaging that is used for diagnostic purposes in medicine. However, NMR often requires powerful magnetic fields to be generated, which limits the scope of its use. Researchers working at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) and the Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) have now discovered potential new ways to reduce the size of the corresponding devices and also the possible associated risk by eliminating the need for strong magnetic fields. This is achieved by combining so-called zero- to ultralow-field NMR with a special hyperpolarization technique. \"This exciting new method is based on an innovative concept. It opens up a whole range of opportunities and overcomes previous disadvantages,\" said Dr. Danila Barskiy, a Sofja Kovalevskaja Award winner who has been working in the relevant discipline at JGU and HIM since 2020.New approach to enable measurements without strong magnetic fieldsThe current generation of NMR devices is—because of the magnets—extremely heavy and expensive. Another complicating factor is the present shortage of liquid helium that is employed as a coolant. \"With our new technique we are gradually moving ZULF NMR towards a status of being completely magnet-free, but we still have many challenges to overcome,\" stated Barskiy.To make magnets redundant in this context, Barskiy has come up with the idea of combining zero- to ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) with a special technique that makes it possible to hyperpolarize atomic nuclei. ZULF NMR is itself a recently developed form of spectroscopy that provides abundant analytical results without the need for large magnetic fields. Another advantage over high-field NMR is the fact that its signals can also be readily detected in the presence of conductive materials, such as metals. The sensors employed for ZULF NMR, typically optically pumped magnetometers, are highly sensitive, easy to use, and they are already commercially available. Thus it is relatively straightforward to assemble a ZULF NMR spectrometer.SABRE-Relay: Transferring spin order like a batonHowever, the generated NMR signal is an issue to be dealt with. The methods that have been used to date to generate the signal are suitable only for the analysis of a limited selection of chemicals or are otherwise associated with exorbitant costs. For this reason, Barskiy has decided to exploit the hyperpolarization technique SABRE which allows aligning nuclear spins at large numbers in solution. There are a number of such techniques that would produce a signal sufficient for detection in ZULF conditions. Among these is SABRE, short for Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange, which has proved to be particularly well suited. Central to the SABRE technique is an iridium metal complex that mediates the transfer of the spin order from parahydrogen to a substrate. Barskiy has managed to sidestep the disadvantages resulting from the temporary binding of the sample to the complex by employing SABRE-Relay, a very recent improvement of the SABRE technique. In this case, SABRE is used to induce polarization which is then relayed to a secondary substrate.Spin chemistry at the interface of physics and chemistryIn their paper titled \"Relayed Hyperpolarization for Zero-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\" published in Science Advances, Dr. Danila Barskiy, lead author Erik Van Dyke, and their co-authors report on how they were able to detect the signals for methanol and ethanol extracted from a sample of vodka.\"This simple example demonstrates how we have been able to extend the application range of ZULF NMR with the help of an inexpensive, rapid, and versatile method of hyperpolarization,\" summarized Barskiy. \"We hope that we've managed to get a little closer to our objective of making feasible the development of compact, portable devices that can be used for the analysis of liquids such as blood and urine and in future, possibly endowing discrimination of particular chemicals such as glucose and amino acids.\"", "abstract": "近日，由德国美茵茨大学领导的研究团队开发出制造低风险、低成本便携式光谱仪的新方法。核磁共振是一种具有广泛应用的分析工具，如用于医学诊断目的的核磁共振成像。然而，核磁共振通常需要产生强大磁场，限制了其使用范围。在新研究中，研究人员发现了通过消除对强磁场的需求减小设备尺寸及可能风险的潜在新方法。这是通过将所谓的零场至超低场核磁共振与特殊的超极化技术相结合来实现的。超低场核磁共振本身是一种最近开发的光谱学形式，无需大磁场即可提供丰富的分析结果。此外，与高场核磁共振相比的另一个优势是，在存在导电材料（如金属）的情况下，可以很容易地检测到它的信号。用于超低场核磁共振的传感器，通常是光泵磁力计，灵敏度高，易于使用，且已经可以在市场上采购。因此，组装超低场核磁共振光谱仪相对简单。新研究为研发超低场核磁共振设备提供了新方案，推动了便携式光谱仪技术的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-09-portable-spectroscopy-devices-real.html"}, {"title": "俄罗斯开发了一种镀铝光纤传感器", "keyword": "镀铝光纤传感器 蒸馏塔 光学传感器", "content_zh": "铝化光纤传感器用于监测工业设施的状况以进行有效的维修。来自Skoltech和哈尔滨工业大学的研究人员设计了一种带有铝涂层的光学传感器系统，该系统可以承受蒸馏塔内的恶劣条件--一个将原油分离为汽油、柴油等的工业设施--并监测其结构健康，避免了无效的全面维修，并能够在出现问题时及时进行有针对性的干预。 这项发表在《光学快报》上的研究是金砖国家科学家成功合作的一个例子。“信息社会正在接近这样一个时刻，每个家用电器和工业设施都将24小时发送关于它在做什么以及它的‘感觉’的报告。” 您可能不一定总是需要这些信息，但它将在那里，使用它的一个有希望的方法是结构健康监测。 也就是说，跟踪桥梁、管道、飞机等组成部分的内部状态，以确定预期故障并进行有针对性的干预，节省大量资源并最大限度地减少停机时间。 研究合著者、该研究所光子学中心的Skoltech副教授Arkady Shipulin评论道。这种高效的维护方法依赖于嵌入结构和车辆中的复杂传感器系统。 尤其是光学传感器，是Skoltech-哈尔滨研究的重点，该研究试图解决石油行业面临的挑战。一般而言，光学传感器是周边控制、监控远距离基础设施的首选技术，如电力线或海底天然气管道，以及炼油和储存设施，在这些设施中，由于燃烧和爆炸危险，电子设备不适用。 这些包括蒸馏塔--将石油分离成有用成分的大型塔，称为馏分--和油罐库，比如2020年俄罗斯诺里尔斯克附近柴油泄漏的故障。“一家公司联系了我们，希望我们开发一种传感器系统，报告蒸馏塔中发生的事情。 你看，它就像一个大黑匣子，一直工作正常，直到它不工作。 然后你必须切开金属，部署一个里面有拖把的人，他环顾四周，清理整件事，希望一切都能再次工作--真的，这不是什么高科技解决方案，“希普林说。没有人在蒸馏塔里安装传感器，因为那里的环境有多恶劣。 希普林的团队与他的中国同事一起开发了一种光学传感器系统的概念，这种系统不仅能够收集必要的数据，而且能够在塔的高温和化学物质中生存下来。 问题的关键是，光纤必须既与环境隔离以进行保护，又充分暴露于环境以进行传感。“你看，这有点矛盾，”希普林说。 “你用什么材料覆盖玻璃纤维来保护它，而不会完全隔绝外部的声波？金属涂层已经使用了很长时间，但主要是在光纤作为与环境隔离的传输通道以防止恶化的地方。一旦它必须充当传感器，阻抗匹配是关键。”材料的阻抗表征了声波（在这种情况下）在其中传播的方式。 研究人员考虑了玻璃和金属涂层阻抗之间的不匹配如何影响进入的声波被反射回环境的程度，从而无法被传感器检测到。 然后，研究小组找到了一种材料，它的阻抗匹配尽可能接近玻璃，而不降低屋顶涂层的成本：铝。既然如何保护光纤但不将其与环境隔离的问题已经初步解决，研究人员可以在实验室测试整个传感系统之前，继续进行一些类似的特定任务。 这项工作既以双边接触的形式进行，就像这次俄中研究一样，也在以金砖国家为基础的更广泛合作的框架内进行。 ", "content_en": "Aluminized fiber-optic sensors to monitor condition of industrial facilities for efficient repairsResearchers from Skoltech and Harbin Institute of Technology have devised a system of optical sensors with an aluminum coating that could withstand the harsh conditions inside a distillation tower—an industrial facility for separating crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel, etc.—and monitor its structural health, avoiding the need for ineffective sweeping repairs and enabling timely targeted interventions when and where problems arise. Published in Optics Letters, the study is an example of a successful collaboration between BRICS scientists.\"Information society is approaching a point where every household appliance and industrial facility will be sending out round-the-clock reports on what it is doing and how it is 'feeling.' You might not necessarily always need this information, but it will be out there, and one of the promising ways of using it is structural health monitoring. That is, tracking the internal state of the constituent parts of bridges, pipelines, aircraft, and so on to pinpoint anticipated failures and enable targeted interventions, saving much resources and minimizing downtime. It's a whole new take on repairing stuff,\" study co-author and Skoltech Associate Professor Arkady Shipulin from the Institute's Photonics Center commented.This highly effective approach to maintenance relies on sophisticated sensor systems embedded into structures and vehicles. Optical sensors, in particular, are the focus of the Skoltech-Harbin study, which attempts to address a challenge faced by the oil industry.In general, optical sensors are the technology of choice for perimeter control, monitoring long-distance infrastructure, such as power lines or, say, undersea gas pipelines, as well as for the facilities used in oil refining and storage, where electronics are inapplicable due to combustion and explosion hazards. These include distillation columns—large towers for separating petroleum into its useful components, called fractions—and oil tank reservoirs, such as the one whose failure led to the 2020 diesel spill near Norilsk, Russia.\"We were approached by a company that wanted us to develop a sensor system that would report what's going on in a distillation tower. You see, it's like a big black box that keeps working fine, until it doesn't. And then you have to literally cut the metal open and deploy a guy with a mop inside, who takes a look around, cleans up the whole thing, and hopefully everything works again—not much of a high-tech solution, really,\" Shipulin said.No one has ever put sensors inside a distillation tower, because of how harsh that environment is. Together with his Chinese colleagues, Shipulin's team developed a concept for an optical sensor system that is not merely capable of collecting the necessary data but would actually survive the tower's hot temperatures and aggressive chemicals. The crux of the problem is that the optical fiber has to be both shielded from the environment for protection and sufficiently exposed to it for sensing.\"It's a bit of a contradiction, you see,\" Shipulin said. \"What material do you coat the glass fiber with to protect it without entirely walling it off from the acoustic waves outside? Metal coatings have been used for a long time, but mostly where the optical fiber serves as a transmission channel sealed off from the environment to prevent deterioration. Once it has to function as a sensor, impedance matching is key.\"The impedance of a material characterizes how acoustic (in this case) waves propagate in it. The researchers considered how a mismatch between the impedances of glass and the metal coating affects to what extent incoming acoustic waves are reflected back into the environment and thus are not detected by the sensor. The team then sought out a material whose impedance matches that of glass as closely as possible without driving the cost of the coating through the roof: aluminum.Now that the problem of how to protect but not isolate the optical fiber from the environment has been tentatively resolved, the researchers can move on to a few similarly specific tasks before testing the entire sensing system as a whole in the lab.

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researchers have created a high-voltage microbattery (> 9 V), with high-energy and -power density, unparalleled by any existing battery design.Material Science and Engineering Professor Paul Braun (Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering, Materials Research Laboratory Director), Dr. Sungbong Kim (Postdoc, MatSE, current assistant professor at Korea Military Academy, co-first author), and Arghya Patra (Graduate Student, MatSE, MRL, co-first author) recently published their paper \"Serially integrated high-voltage and high-power miniature batteries\" in Cell Reports Physical Science.The team demonstrated hermetically sealed (tightly closed to prevent exposure to ambient air), durable, compact, lithium batteries with exceptionally low package mass fraction in single-, double-, and triple-stacked configurations with unprecedented operating voltages, high power densities, and energy densities.Braun explains, \"We need powerful tiny batteries to unlock the full potential of microscale devices, by improving the electrode architectures and coming up with innovative battery designs.\" The problem is that as batteries become smaller, the packaging dominates the battery volume and mass while the electrode area becomes smaller. This results in drastic reductions in energy and power of the battery.In their unique design of powerful microbatteries, the team developed novel packaging technology that used the positive and negative terminal current collectors as part of the packaging itself (rather than a separate entity). This allowed for the compact volume (≤ 0.165 cm3) and low package mass fraction (10.2%) of the batteries. In addition, they vertically stacked the electrode cells in series (so the voltage of each cell adds), which enabled the high operating voltage of the battery.Another way these microbatteries are improved is by using very dense electrodes which offers energy density. Normal electrodes are almost 40% by volume occupied by polymers and carbon additives (not active materials). Braun's group has grown electrodes by an intermediate temperature direct electrodeposition technique which are fully dense and without polymer and carbon additives. These fully dense electrodes offer more volumetric energy density than their commercial counterparts. The microbatteries in this research were fabricated using the dense electroplated DirectPlate LiCoO2 electrodes manufactured by Xerion Advanced Battery Corporation (XABC, Dayton, Ohio), a company that spun out of Braun's research.Patra mentions, \"To date, electrode architectures and cell designs at the micro-nano scale have been limited to power dense designs that came at the cost of porosity and volumetric energy density. Our work has been successful to create a microscale energy source that exhibits both high power density and volumetric energy density.\"An important application space of these microbatteries includes powering insect-size microrobots to obtain valuable information during natural disasters, search and rescue missions, and in hazardous environments where direct human access is impossible.Co-author James Pikul (Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania) points out that \"the high voltage is important for reducing the electronic payload that a microrobot needs to carry. 9 V can directly power motors and reduce the energy loss associated with boosting the voltage to the hundreds or thousands of volts needed from some actuators. This means that these batteries enable system level improvements beyond their energy density enhancement so that the small robots can travel farther or send more critical information to human operators.\"Kim adds, \"Our work bridges the knowledge gap at the intersection of materials chemistry, unique materials manufacturing requirements for energy dense planar microbattery configurations, and applied nano-microelectronics that require a high-voltage, on-board type power source to drive microactuators and micromotors.\"Braun, a pioneer in the field of battery miniaturization, concludes, \"our current microbattery design is well-suited for high-energy, high-power, high-voltage, single-discharge applications. The next step is to translate the design to all solid-state microbattery platforms, batteries which would inherently be safer and more energy dense than liquid-cell counterparts.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国伊利诺伊大学厄巴纳-香槟分校研究人员开发出一种新型高压微电池，具有高能量和高功率密度，是任何现有电池都无法比拟的。在制造微电池的过程中，研究人员利用了新的封装技术，将电池正极和负极电流收集器作为封装的一部分，而不是单独实体，使电池体积小于0.165 cm3，十分紧凑，且包装质量较轻。此外，研究人员还将电极单元垂直堆叠在一起，使每个单元的工作电压增加，使电池能在高工作电压下工作。此外，研究人员通过直接电沉积技术生长出完全致密且不含聚合物和碳添加剂的电极，这些致密电极能够比现有普通电极提供更大的体积能量密度。该微电池设计非常适合高能量、高功率、高电压、单次放电应用，为微型高电压电池技术的发展提供了新的技术路径。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-powerful-microbatteries.html"}, {"title": "美国首次在室温环境下发现奇异的量子态", "keyword": "拓扑绝缘体 量子效应 溴化铋 无机晶体化合物", "content_zh": "科学家首次发现室温下的奇异量子态物理学家在室温下观察到拓扑绝缘体中的新量子效应。 这一突破发表在《自然材料》10月号的封面文章中，当时普林斯顿大学的科学家探索了一种基于铋元素的拓扑材料。十多年来，科学家们一直使用拓扑绝缘体来证明量子效应，但这次实验是第一次在室温下观察到这些效应。 通常，在拓扑绝缘体中诱导和观察量子态需要接近绝对零度的温度，即零下459华氏度（或零下273摄氏度）。这一发现为发展高效的量子技术开辟了一系列新的可能性，如基于自旋的电子学，它可能取代许多现有的电子系统以获得更高的能量效率。近年来，物质拓扑态的研究引起了物理学家和工程师的极大关注，目前是国际上许多兴趣和研究的焦点。 这一研究领域将量子物理与拓扑学结合起来--拓扑学是理论数学的一个分支，探索可以变形但不会本质改变的几何性质。领导这项研究的普林斯顿大学尤金·希金斯物理学教授M.扎希德·哈桑（M.Zahid Hasan）说：“无论是从基础物理学的角度，还是从寻找下一代量子工程和纳米技术的潜在应用来看，物质的新颖拓扑性质都已经成为现代物理学中最受欢迎的宝藏之一。”“这项工作是由我们普林斯顿实验室的多项创新实验进展促成的，” 哈桑补充道。用来研究量子拓扑奥秘的主要器件部件被称为拓扑绝缘体。 这是一种独特的设备，在其内部充当绝缘体，这意味着内部的电子不能自由移动，因此不能导电，然而，设备边缘的电子可以自由移动，这意味着它们是导电的。 此外，由于拓扑结构的特殊性质，电子沿边缘流动不受任何缺陷或形变的阻碍。 这种器件不仅具有改进技术的潜力，而且可以通过探索量子电子特性来更好地理解物质本身。然而，迄今为止，将这种材料和器件应用于功能器件的探索一直是一个主要的绊脚石。 哈桑说：“人们对拓扑材料很感兴趣，人们经常谈论它们在实际应用中的巨大潜力，但在室温下表现出某种宏观量子拓扑效应之前，这些应用可能不会实现。”这是因为环境或高温会产生物理学家所说的“热噪声”，其定义是温度上升，以至于原子开始剧烈振动。 这个动作会扰乱精细的量子系统，从而使量子态坍缩。 特别是在拓扑绝缘体中，这些较高的温度造成一种情况，即绝缘体表面的电子侵入绝缘体的内部或“体”，并导致那里的电子也开始导电，这稀释或破坏了特殊的量子效应。解决这一问题的方法是将这种实验置于异常寒冷的温度下，通常是绝对零度或接近绝对零度。 在这些令人难以置信的低温下，原子和亚原子粒子停止振动，因此更容易操纵。 然而，创建和维护超冷环境对许多应用来说是不切实际的； 它昂贵、笨重，消耗大量能源。但哈桑和他的团队开发了一种创新的方法来绕过这个问题。 基于他们在拓扑材料方面的经验，并与许多合作者合作，他们制造了一种新的拓扑绝缘体，由溴化铋（化学式α-Bi4Br4)制成，溴化铋是一种无机晶体化合物，有时用于水处理和化学分析。“这太棒了，我们在没有巨大压力或超高磁场的情况下发现了它们，从而使这些材料更容易用于开发下一代量子技术，”获得博士学位的娜娜·舒米亚说 她是普林斯顿大学电气和计算机工程的博士后研究员，也是该论文的三名共同第一作者之一。她补充说，“我相信我们的发现将显著推进量子前沿。”这一发现的根源在于量子霍尔效应的工作原理--一种拓扑效应的形式，是1985年诺贝尔物理学奖的主题。 从那时起，拓扑阶段一直在进行着激烈的研究 ", "content_en": "Scientists discover exotic quantum state at room temperatureFor the first time, physicists have observed novel quantum effects in a topological insulator at room temperature. This breakthrough, published as the cover article of the October issue of Nature Materials, came when Princeton scientists explored a topological material based on the element bismuth.The scientists have used topological insulators to demonstrate quantum effects for more than a decade, but this experiment is the first time these effects have been observed at room temperature. Typically, inducing and observing quantum states in topological insulators requires temperatures around absolute zero, which is equal to -459 degrees Fahrenheit (or -273 degrees Celsius).This finding opens up a new range of possibilities for the development of efficient quantum technologies, such as spin-based electronics, which may potentially replace many current electronic systems for higher energy efficiency.In recent years, the study of topological states of matter has attracted considerable attention among physicists and engineers and is presently the focus of much international interest and research. This area of study combines quantum physics with topology—a branch of theoretical mathematics that explores geometric properties that can be deformed but not intrinsically changed.\"The novel topological properties of matter have emerged as one of the most sought-after treasures in modern physics, both from a fundamental physics point of view and for finding potential applications in next-generation quantum engineering and nanotechnologies,\" said M. Zahid Hasan, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton University, who led the research.\"This work was enabled by multiple innovative experimental advances in our lab at Princeton,\" added Hasan.The main device component used to investigate the mysteries of quantum topology is called a topological insulator. This is a unique device that act as an insulator in its interior, which means that the electrons inside are not free to move around and therefore do not conduct electricity.However, the electrons on the device's edges are free to move around, meaning they are conductive. Moreover, because of the special properties of topology, the electrons flowing along the edges are not hampered by any defects or deformations. This device has the potential not only of improving technology but also of generating a greater understanding of matter itself by probing quantum electronic properties.Until now, however, there has been a major stumbling block in the quest to use the materials and devices for applications in functional devices. \"There is a lot of interest in topological materials and people often talk about their great potential for practical applications,\" said Hasan, \"but until some macroscopic quantum topological effect can be manifested at room temperature, these applications will likely remain unrealized.\"This is because ambient or high temperatures create what physicists call \"thermal noise,\" which is defined as a rise in temperature such that the atoms begin to vibrate violently. This action can disrupt delicate quantum systems, thereby collapsing the quantum state. In topological insulators, in particular, these higher temperatures create a situation in which the electrons on the surface of the insulator invade the interior, or \"bulk,\" of the insulator, and cause the electrons there to also begin conducting, which dilutes or breaks the special quantum effect.The way around this is to subject such experiments to exceptionally cold temperatures, typically at or near absolute zero. At these incredibly low temperatures, atomic and subatomic particles cease vibrating and are consequently easier to manipulate. However, creating and maintaining an ultra-cold environment is impractical for many applications; it is costly, bulky and consumes a considerable amount of energy.But Hasan and his team have developed an innovative way to bypass this problem. Building on their experience with topological materials and working with many collaborators, they fabricated a new kind of topological insulator made from bismuth bromide (chemical formula α-Bi4Br4), which is an inorganic crystalline compound sometimes used for water treatment and chemical analyses.\"This is just terrific that we found them without giant pressure or an ultra-high magnetic field, thus making the materials more accessible for developing next-generation quantum technology,\" said Nana Shumiya, who earned her Ph.D. at Princeton, is a postdoctoral research associate in electrical and computer engineering, and is one of the three co-first authors of the paper.She added, \"I believe our discovery will significantly advance the quantum frontier.\"The discovery's roots lie in the workings of the quantum Hall effect—a form of topological effect that was the subject of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1985. Since that time, topological phases have been intensely studied. Many new classes of quantum materials with topological electronic structures have been found, including topological insulators, topological superconductors, topological magnets and Weyl semimetals.While experimental discoveries were rapidly being made, theoretical discoveries were also progressing. Important theoretical concepts on two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators were put forward in 1988 by F. Duncan Haldane, the Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics at Princeton.He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016 for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and a type of 2D topological insulators. Subsequent theoretical developments showed that topological insulators can take the form of two copies of Haldane's model based on electron's spin-orbit interaction.Hasan and his team have been on a decade-long search for a topological quantum state that may also operate at room temperature, following their discovery of the first examples of three-dimensional topological insulators in 2007. Recently, they found a materials solution to Haldane's conjecture in a kagome lattice magnet that is capable of operating at room temperature, which also exhibits the desired quantization.\"The kagome lattice topological insulators can be designed to possess relativistic band crossings and strong electron-electron interactions. Both are essential for novel magnetism,\" said Hasan. \"Therefore, we realized that kagome magnets are a promising system in which to search for topological magnet phases, as they are like the topological insulators that we discovered and studied more than ten years ago.\"\"A suitable atomic chemistry and structure design coupled to first-principles theory is the crucial step to make topological insulator's speculative prediction realistic in a high-temperature setting,\" said Hasan. \"There are hundreds of topological materials, and we need both intuition, experience, materials-specific calculations, and intense experimental efforts to eventually find the right material for in-depth exploration. And that took us on a decade-long journey of investigating many bismuth-based materials.\"Insulators, like semiconductors, have what are called insulating, or band, gaps. These are in essence \"barriers\" between orbiting electrons, a sort of \"no-man's-land\" where electrons cannot go. These band gaps are extremely important because, among other things, they provide the lynchpin in overcoming the limitation of achieving a quantum state imposed by thermal noise.They do this if the width of the band gap exceeds the width of the thermal noise. But too large a band gap can potentially disrupt the spin-orbit coupling of the electrons—this is the interaction between the electron's spin and its orbital motion around the nucleus. When this disruption occurs, the topological quantum state collapses. Therefore, the trick in inducing and maintaining a quantum effect is to find a balance between a large band gap and the spin-orbit coupling effects.Following a proposal by collaborators and co-authors Fan Zhang and Yugui Yao to explore a type of Weyl metals, Hasan and team studied the bismuth bromide family of materials. But the team was not able to observe the Weyl phenomena in these materials. Hasan and his team instead discovered that the bismuth bromide insulator has properties that make it more ideal compared to a bismuth-antimony based topological insulator (Bi-Sb alloys) that they had studied before.It has a large insulating gap of over 200?meV (\"milli electron volts\"). This is large enough to overcome thermal noise, but small enough so that it does not disrupt the spin-orbit coupling effect and band inversion topology.\"In this case, in our experiments, we found a balance between spin-orbit coupling effects and large band gap width,\" said Hasan. \"We found there is a 'sweet spot' where you can have relatively large spin-orbit coupling to create a topological twist as well as raise the band gap without destroying it. It's kind of like a balance point for the bismuth-based materials that we have been studying for a long time.\"The researchers knew they had achieved their goal when they viewed what was going on in the experiment through a sub-atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscope, a unique device that uses a property known as \"quantum tunneling,\" where electrons are funneled between the sharp metallic, single-atom tip of the microscope and the sample.The microscope uses this tunneling current rather than light to view the world of electrons on the atomic scale. The researchers observed a clear quantum spin Hall edge state, which is one of the important properties that uniquely exist in topological systems. This required additional novel instrumentation to uniquely isolate the topological effect.\"For the first time, we demonstrated that there's a class of bismuth-based topological materials that the topology survives up to room temperature,\" said Hasan. \"We are very confidant of our result.\"This finding is the culmination of many years of hard-won experimental work and required additional novel instrumentation ideas to be introduced in the experiments. Hasan has been a leading researcher in the field of experimental quantum topological materials with novel experimentation methodologies for over 15 years; and, indeed, was one of the field's early pioneer researchers.Between 2005 and 2007, for example, he and his team of researchers discovered topological order in a three-dimensional bismuth-antimony bulk solid, a semiconducting alloy and related topological Dirac materials using novel experimental methods. This led to the discovery of topological magnetic materials. Between 2014 and 2015, they discovered a new class of topological materials called magnetic Weyl semimetals.The researchers believe this breakthrough will open the door to a whole host of future research possibilities and applications in quantum technologies.\"We believe this finding may be the starting point of future development in nanotechnology,\" said Shafayat Hossain, a postdoctoral research associate in Hasan's lab and another co-first author of the study. \"There have been so many proposed possibilities in topological technology that await, and finding appropriate materials coupled with novel instrumentation is one of the keys for this.\"One area of research where Hasan and his team believe this breakthrough will have particular impact is on next-generation quantum technologies. The researchers believe this new breakthrough will hasten the development of more efficient, and \"greener\" quantum materials.Currently, the theoretical and experimental focus of the group is concentrated in two directions, said Hasan.First, the researchers want to determine what other topological materials might operate at room temperature, and, importantly, provide other scientists the tools and novel instrumentation methods to identify materials that will operate at room and high temperatures.Second, the researchers want to continue to probe deeper into the quantum world now that this finding has made it possible to conduct experiments at higher temperatures.These studies will require the development of another set of new instrumentations and techniques to fully harness the enormous potential of these materials. \"I see a tremendous opportunity for further in-depth exploration of exotic and complex quantum phenomena with our new instrumentation, tracking more finer details in macroscopic quantum states,\" Hasan said. \"Who knows what we will discover?\"\"Our research is a real step forward in demonstrating the potential of topological materials for energy-saving applications,\" added Hasan. \"What we've done here with this experiment is plant a seed to encourage other scientists and engineers to dream big.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国普林斯顿大学的研究人员在探索基于元素铋的拓扑材料时，首次在温室环境下观察到拓扑绝缘体中的新量子效应，为开发出有效的量子技术开辟了新的可能性。研究人员在实验中制造出了一种由溴化铋制成的新型拓扑绝缘体，这一拓扑绝缘体的绝缘带隙超过200毫电子伏，足以克服“热噪音”，也不会破坏自旋轨道耦合效应和带反转拓扑。当通过亚原子分辨率扫描隧道显微镜观察时，可以清晰地观察到只在拓扑系统内存在的重要量子特性之一的量子自旋霍尔边缘态。这一突破将为下一代量子技术的发展和应用奠定基础，也将加速更优异“绿色”量子材料的开发。目前，该团队的下一步计划是确定能否在室温下在其他拓扑材料内发现同样的量子效应，也希望在更高温度下开展此类实验。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-10-scientists-exotic-quantum-state-room.html"}, {"title": "美国推出面向移动设备的高级DRAM1-beta节点", "keyword": "动态随机存取内存 纳米制造技术", "content_zh": "Micron发布了其先进的DRAM 1-beta节点，目标是MobileClai将其作为业界最先进的DRAM技术，Micron Technology发布了其先进的1-beta DRAM节点。在过去的十年里，半导体的缩放速度明显放缓，但似乎没有任何技术比DRAM的缩放速度更慢。 由于物理技术的限制，DRAM与VLSI相比已经明显落后，然而，业界正在努力改变这种说法，并在架构和制造方面提出创新的解决方案，以实现DRAM节点尺寸的减小。 美光科技被广泛认为是DRAM领域的领导者，因此，他们一直处于这一努力的前沿。 昨天，美光宣布发布其先进的1-beta DRAM节点。在本文中，我们将讨论新节点，它带来的好处，以及美光实现这一壮举的意想不到的方式。 我们还分享了一些来自Thy Tran的见解，他是美光负责DRAM工艺集成的副总裁，昨天在美光的新闻发布会上发表了这一声明。 Thy Tran在今年早些时候我们的女性历史月系列中的一篇关于电路的文章中有特色。美光的1-beta NodeMicron宣布，它已经开始运送其下一代1-beta DRAM节点的合格样本。 继美光的1-Alpha节点之后，1-Beta是一项技术改进，能够实现更高性能的DRAME。据美光称，与前几代节点相比，新节点的功耗效率提高了15%，比特密度提高了35%以上，单次容量为16 GB。1-Beta节点的第一个应用来自美光的下一代低功耗双倍数据率5x(LPDDR5x)移动存储器。 这项技术目前正在向移动设计师提供样品，是一个16 GB的产品，据说速度可达8.5 Gbps。 除了从缩放中节省功率，美光还声称，他们的新LPDDR5x还通过实现JEDEC增强的动态电压和频率缩放来节省功率。 根据美光的说法，他们设想他们的新1-beta DRAM的应用包括移动和实时服务，如自动车辆和数据中心。绕过EUV制造1-beta节点的一个独特方面是美光到达那里的原因。 当大多数行业都在转向极紫外(EUV)制造技术来进行节点缩放时，美光已经找到了一种完全没有EUV的方法来实现1-β。相反，美光利用了一种基于传统光刻的专有纳米制造技术。 该技术包括先进的多图案和浸没能力，以确保这些微小的特征可以产生极高的精度。 根据美光的说法，这一制造过程已经准备好批量生产。你的Tran将美光的成就放在了正确的位置。 “每次我们似乎认为我们不能挤出另一个节点，我们就让它发生了，”她说。 “这真的很了不起。 随着每一个节点，随着每一个处理单元，半导体行业几十年来每一年或二十年都在缩小设备。 然而，随着芯片越来越小，定义晶圆上的电路模式需要挑战物理定律。“”对于微米来说，有志者事竟成。 我们为我们的战略感到自豪，即只有在经济合理和性能合理的时候才部署EUV。 因此，我们能够进一步创新我们的多图案技术，以避免EUV。“为了实现这一技术里程碑，Tran说，美光对关键层的工艺控制实际上是埃级的。 “这就是我们字面上的意思，每一埃都很重要，”她说。 “我们不仅必须创新，让一些事情成为可能，只需一两次，我们还必须开发可重复的工艺，在日复一日的大规模制造中，在10多个步骤中近乎完美。”通过避免对EUV的需求，美光推动了行业的前进，证明了我们还可以从更传统的制造工艺中挤出更多的汁液。 这不仅为DRAM扩展的未来提供了乐观，而不需要外来的新技术，而且也表明DRAM扩展的上限可能高于最初的预期。根据Micron的说法，一旦当前设备通过认证程序，新的1-beta节点将开始大规模生产。 ", "content_en": "Micron Ships its Advanced DRAM 1-beta Node, Targeting MobileClaiming it as the industry’s most advanced DRAM technology, Micron Technology has released its advanced 1-beta DRAM node.Semiconductor scaling has notably slowed down in pace over the past decade, but seemingly no technology has scaled slower than DRAM. Due to the physical constraints of the technology, DRAM has lagged behind significantly as compared to VLSI.Still, the industry is working to change this narrative and come up with innovative solutions in architecture and manufacturing to enable decreased DRAM node sizes. Micron Technology is widely considered a leader in the DRAM field, and as such, they’ve been at the forefront of this effort. Yesterday, Micron announced the release of its advanced 1-beta DRAM node.In this article, we’ll talk about the new node, the benefits it brings, and the unexpected way Micron achieved this feat. We also share some insights from Thy Tran, Micron’s Vice President of DRAM Process Integration who presented at Micron’s press conference for the announcement yesterday. Thy Tran was featured in an All About Circuits article in our Women’s History Month series earlier this year.Micron’s 1-Beta NodeMicron announced that it has begun shipping qualification samples of its next-generation 1-beta DRAM node. Following on the heels of Micron’s 1-alpha node, 1-beta is a technological improvement that enables higher-performance DRAM.According to Micron, the new node is responsible for achieving a 15% power efficiency improvement and more than a 35% bit density improvement as compared to previous generations in the form of a 16 Gb capacity per die.The first application of the 1-beta node comes in Micron’s next-generation low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) mobile memory. The technology, which is currently shipping in samples to mobile designers, is a 16 Gb offering and is said to deliver speeds up to 8.5 Gbps. Along with the power savings from scaling, Micron also claims that their new LPDDR5x also saves power through the implementation of JEDEC-enhanced dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. According to Micron, they envision the applications of their new 1-beta DRAM to include mobile as well as real-time services such as autonomous vehicles and data centers.Bypassing EUV ManufacturingOne unique aspect of the 1-beta node is how Micron got there. While most of the industry is turning towards extreme ultraviolet (EUV) manufacturing techniques for node scaling, Micron has found a way to achieve 1-beta without EUV at all.Instead, Micron leverages a proprietary nanomanufacturing technique that is based on conventional lithography. The technique includes advanced multi-patterning and immersion capabilities to ensure that these tiny features can be produced with extremely high precision. According to Micron, this manufacturing process is ready for mass production.Thy Tran puts Micron’s achievement into perspective. “Every time we seem to think that we can't squeeze out another node, we make it happen,” she says. “It is truly remarkable. With each node, with each processing unit, the semiconductor industry has been shrinking devices every year or two for decades. However, as the chip has grown smaller, defining the circuit patterns on wafers requires literally challenging the laws of physics.”“For Micron, where there's a will, there's a way. We're proud of our strategy to only deploy EUV at the right time, when the economics make sense and the performance makes sense. So, we’re able to innovate our multi-patterning techniques even further to avoid EUV.”To accomplish this technology milestone, Tran says that Micron’s process controls for the critical layers are literally at the angstrom level. “This is where we literally mean that every angstrom counts,” she says. “Not only do we have to innovate to make something possible just once or twice, we have to develop processes that are repeatable and nearly perfect across 10+ steps in high volume manufacturing day in and day out.”Pushing the Industry ForwardBy staving off the need for EUV, Micron is proving that there is still more juice that we can squeeze out of more conventional manufacturing processes. This not only provides optimism for the future of DRAM scaling without the need for exotic new technologies, but it also suggests that the ceiling for DRAM scaling may be higher than originally expected.According to Micron, mass production of the new 1-beta node will begin once current devices pass qualification procedures.", "abstract": "近日，美国美光科技公司发布了业界最先进的技术1-beta动态随机存取内存节点技术。该技术是继美光1-alpha节点之后的一项改进技术，可实现更高性能的动态随机存取内存。美光科技表示，与前几代产品相比，新节点的功率效率提高了15%，位密度提高了35% 以上，每个芯片的容量为16吉比特。该技术制造采用专有纳米制造技术，可实现极高的微小特征制造精度，易于实现大规模生产。目前，该技术被用于美光低功耗双倍数据速率5X (LPDDR5X) 移动内存上，以样品形式提供给移动设计人员使用。", "link": "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/micron-ships-its-advanced-dram-1-beta-node-targeting-mobile/"}, {"title": "澳大利亚开发出可以精确测量微观量子物体的新技术", "keyword": "量子计算机 量子纠缠 共轭属性 生物医学测量", "content_zh": "精确测量微小量子物体的新技术澳大利亚国立大学(ANU)的一个科学家小组领导的一项新研究概述了一种使用量子计算机实现更精确测量微观物体的方法--这一步骤可能在包括生物医学传感在内的大量下一代技术中被证明是有用的。检查像汽车这样的大型日常物体的各种特性相当简单：汽车有明确定义的位置、颜色和速度。 然而，当试图研究像光子这样的微观量子物体时，这就变得更加棘手了，因为量子物体的某些性质是相互联系的，测量一种性质可能会干扰另一种性质。 例如，测量电子的位置会影响其速度，反之亦然，这种性质称为共轭性质。 这是海森堡著名测不准原理的直接体现--不可能以任意精度同时测量一个量子物体的两个共轭性质。 研究人员洛坎·康隆，这是量子力学的决定性挑战之一。“我们能够设计一种测量方法，以更准确地确定量子物体的共轭性质。值得注意的是，我们的合作者能够在世界各地的各种实验室实施这项测量，”康隆说。“更精确的测量至关重要，反过来可以为各种技术开辟新的可能性，包括生物医学传感、激光测距和量子通信。”这项新技术围绕着量子系统的一个奇怪的怪癖，即被称为纠缠。 根据研究人员的说法，通过将两个相同的量子物体纠缠在一起并测量它们，科学家可以比单独测量它们更精确地确定它们的性质。合著者赛义德·阿萨德博士说：“通过将两个相同的量子系统纠缠在一起，我们可以获得更多的信息。” “在测量量子系统的任何性质时，都有一些不可避免的噪声。通过将两者纠缠在一起，我们能够减少这种噪声，并获得更准确的测量。”理论上，纠缠和测量三个或更多量子系统以达到更高的精度是可能的，但在这种情况下，实验与理论不符。 然而，作者相信未来的量子计算机将能够克服这些限制。康伦说：“具有纠错量子比特的量子计算机将能够在未来以越来越多的副本进行有收益的测量。”根据材料研究与工程研究所(IMRE)首席量子科学家林平科教授的说法，这项工作的关键优势之一是在嘈杂的场景中仍然可以观察到量子增强。“对于实际应用，如生物医学测量， 重要的是，即使信号不可避免地嵌入到嘈杂的现实环境中，我们也能看到优势，“他说。这项研究是由ARC量子计算和通信技术卓越中心(CQC2T)的专家与A*Star材料研究和工程研究所(IMRE)、耶拿大学、因斯布鲁克大学和麦考瑞大学的研究人员合作进行的。 亚马逊网络服务通过提供研究和架构支持以及使用亚马逊Braket提供Rigetti Aspen-9设备进行合作。研究人员在三个不同平台的19台不同量子计算机上测试了他们的理论：超导、囚禁离子和光子量子计算机。 这些世界领先的设备位于欧洲和美国，可以云访问，允许来自全球的研究人员连接并进行重要的研究。这项研究已经发表在《自然物理学》上。 ", "content_en": "New techniques for accurate measurements of tiny quantum objectsNew research led by a team of scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) has outlined a way to achieve more accurate measurements of microscopic objects using quantum computers—a step that could prove useful in a huge range of next-generation technologies, including biomedical sensing.Examining the various individual properties of a large everyday object like a car is fairly simple: a car has a well-defined position, color and speed. However, this becomes much trickier when trying to examine microscopic quantum objects like photons—tiny little particles of light.That's because certain properties of quantum objects are connected, and measuring one property can disturb another property. For example, measuring the position of an electron will affect its speed and vice versa.Such properties are called conjugate properties. This is a direct manifestation of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle—it is not possible to simultaneously measure two conjugate properties of a quantum object with arbitrary accuracy.According to lead author and ANU Ph.D. researcher Lorcán Conlon, this is one of the defining challenges of quantum mechanics.\"We were able to design a measurement to determine conjugate properties of quantum objects more accurately. Remarkably, our collaborators were able to implement this measurement in various labs around the world,\" Conlon said.\"More accurate measurements are crucial, and can in turn open up new possibilities for all sorts of technologies, including biomedical sensing, laser ranging, and quantum communications.\"The new technique revolves around a strange quirk of quantum systems, known as entanglement. According to the researchers, by entangling two identical quantum objects and measuring them together, scientists can determine their properties more precisely than if they were measured individually.\"By entangling two identical quantum systems, we can acquire more information,\" co-author Dr. Syed Assad said. \"There is some unavoidable noise associated with measuring any property of a quantum system. By entangling the two, we're able to reduce this noise and get a more accurate measurement.\"In theory, it is possible to entangle and measure three or more quantum systems to achieve even better precision, but in this case the experiments failed to agree with the theory. Nevertheless, the authors are confident that future quantum computers will be able to overcome these limitations.\"Quantum computers with error-corrected qubits will be able to gainfully measure with more and more copies in the future,\" Conlon said.According to Professor Ping Koy Lam, A*STAR chief quantum scientist at Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), one of the key strengths of this work is that a quantum-enhancement can still be observed in noisy scenarios.\"For practical applications, such as in biomedical measurements, it is important that we can see an advantage even when the signal is inevitably embedded in a noisy real-world environment,\" he said.The study was conducted by experts at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T), in collaboration with researchers from A*STAR's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), the University of Jena, the University of Innsbruck, and Macquarie University.

Over the past decade or so, these devices have proved to be very valuable solutions for controlling the flow of current in semiconductors.To further develop FETs, electronics engineers worldwide have recently been trying to reduce their size. While these down-scaling efforts have been found to increase the device's speed and lower the power consumption, they are also associated with short-channel effects (i.e., unfavorable effects that occur when an FET's channel length is approximately equal to the space charge regions of source and drain junctions within its substrate).These undesirable effects, which include barrier lowering and velocity saturation, could be suppressed by using 2D semiconductor channels with high carrier mobilities and ultrathin high-k dielectrics (i.e., materials with high dielectric constants). Integrating 2D semiconductors with dielectrics with similar oxide thicknesses has been found to be highly challenging.Researchers at Peking University and University of Texas at Austin have recently demonstrated the successful integration of a sub-0.5nm dielectric layer with 2D semiconductor-based transistors. Their design, introduced in a paper published in Nature Electronics, could ultimately pave the way towards the development of smaller, faster, and more efficient FETs.\"Previously we have synthesized a poly-crystalline high-κ (dielectric constant) native oxide dielectric of 2D Bi2O2Se and found that its equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) can be scaled down to 0.9 nm, but the leakage current exceeds the low-power limit,\" Hailin Peng, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. \"Inspired by the layered crystal structure of 2D Bi2O2Se and the intercalation of 2D materials, we designed an intercalative oxidation process to retain the lattice framework of the precursor, to obtain a single-crystalline native oxide with better insulativity for further downscaling.\"To integrate their dielectric with 2D semiconductors, Peng and his colleagues used a process called UV-assisted intercalative oxidation. Firstly, they decomposed oxygen molecules contained in the air into atomic oxygen using 185 nm ultraviolet (UV) rays emitted from a low-pressure mercury lamp.Subsequently, they used the atomic oxygen to oxidize the Se2- layer in the 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se between the two [Bi2O2]n2n+ layers, without affecting the properties of the [Bi2O2]n2n+ layers. This process led to the formation of a new 'layered phase,\" which inherited the single-crystalline [Bi2O2]n2n+ structure of the original Bi2O2Se sample.\"The as-synthesized oxide is further confirmed to be a single-crystalline native dielectric and named β-Bi2SeO5,\" Peng explained. \"The single-crystalline native oxide β-Bi2SeO5 has a thickness-independent high dielectric constant of about 22, ultraflat lattice-matched interface, and excellent insulativity. Even when scaled down to 2.3 nm and the EOT (equivalent oxide thickness, 3.9×thickness/dielectric constant) is as low as 0.41 nm, the leakage current at 1 V gate voltage is still below the low-power limit (0.015 A/cm2), meeting the industrial requirements of dielectrics in next-generation transistors.\"The initial tests carried out by Peng and his colleagues yielded interesting results. Overall, their findings suggest β-Bi2SeO5, the material they created, could be promising for developing an ultrathin high-κ (dielectric constant) gate dielectric in 2D transistors.\"The most notable achievement of our study was the successful integration of sub-0.5-nm-EOT dielectrics in top-gated 2D transistors, which meets the benchmarks of dielectric in the 2021 International Roadmap for Devices and Systems,\" Peng said. \"Thus, one of the challenges for 2D electronics, the integration with sub-0.5-nm-EOT ultrathin high-κ dielectric, has been overcome.\"This team of researchers demonstrated the possibility of integrating 2D semiconductors with high-k dielectrics. In the future, the material that they created and the method introduced in their paper could be used to create smaller and highly-performing FETs that are not adversely impacted by short-channel effects.\"We will now further investigate the compatibility of β-Bi2SeO5 with other common 2D materials and metal electrodes,\" Peng added. \"In addition, a large-scale transfer process of Bi2SeO5 or its precursor Bi2O2Se is also desired for the integration of this ultrathin high-κ dielectric with a broad range of 2D materials.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校研究人员成功将0.5纳米超薄电介质层与二维半导体晶体管集成在一起。受二维半导体Bi2O2Se的拉链形层状结构的启发，研究人员使用紫外光辅助插层氧化方法实现了新型自然氧化物单晶栅介质β-Bi2SeO5的可控制备，其介电常数高达22，且绝缘性能非常优异。这使二维Bi2O2Se/Bi2SeO5基顶栅场效应晶体管的栅介电层等效氧化层厚度微缩至0.41纳米，突破了二维材料电子器件超薄栅介质集成的瓶颈。单晶β-Bi2SeO5可用作二维Bi2O2Se基晶体管的理想栅介质，以满足业界低功耗器件对栅介质厚度的要求，同时相对于一些常用的栅介质，其在等效厚度与绝缘性方面均具有优势。该项研究成果弥补了二维半导体材料在超薄栅介质集成方面的短板，对未来二维材料电子器件发展具有重要意义。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-successful-sub-05nm-dielectric-2d-semiconductors.html"}, {"title": "澳大利亚开发出可用于消除超级细菌的新型光疗法", "keyword": "抗生素耐药性 抗菌光动力疗法 光动力技术", "content_zh": "新一代光激活纳米技术用于耐抗生素超级细菌新一代光激活纳米技术证明它可以根除世界上一些最臭名昭著和潜在致命的细菌，从而“熄灭”耐抗生素超级细菌。由南澳大利亚大学开发并发表在《药剂学》上，新的光疗法可以将耐抗生素超级细菌金色葡萄球菌和铜绿假单胞菌分别消除50万倍和10万倍。金色葡萄球菌（金黄色葡萄球菌）和铜绿假单胞菌是世界上最致命的超级细菌之一。 全球约有127万人死于抗生素耐药性细菌。Unisa的首席研究员穆罕默德·阿瓦德博士说，这种新的光疗法将改变全球数百万人的游戏规则。“金色葡萄球菌和铜绿假单胞菌都是高度传播的细菌，通常存在于人们的皮肤上。 但是如果它们进入血液，它们会导致败血症甚至死亡，“阿瓦德博士说医院里的病人--尤其是那些有伤口或导管的病人，或者那些使用呼吸机的病人--感染这些细菌的风险更高，虽然抗生素可能有所帮助，但它们的广泛使用导致了微生物耐药性的波动，通常使它们无效。”我们的光动力技术工作方式不同，利用光的能量产生高度活性氧分子，这些分子可以根除微生物细胞，杀死致命的细菌， 不伤害人类细胞。“研究人员对由耐抗生素的金色葡萄球菌和铜绿假单胞菌引起的顽固性细菌感染进行了抗菌光动力疗法的测试。Unisa的高级研究员克莱夫·普雷斯蒂奇教授说，这项技术比传统抗生素和其他光疗法有一些关键优势。”这种新疗法是在一种油中产生的，这种油作为洗剂涂在伤口上。 “当激光照射到洗剂上时，它会产生活性氧，作为传统抗生素的替代品，”普雷斯蒂奇教授说目前的光活性化合物也存在水溶性差的问题，这意味着它们在临床上的应用有限。“我们的方法使用食品级脂质为光活性化合物构建纳米载体，这大大提高了其溶解度和抗菌效率，远远超过了未配制的化合物。”这些分子同时针对多个细菌细胞，防止细菌适应和产生耐药性。 因此，这是一种更加有效和稳健的治疗方法。“重要的是，参与伤口愈合过程的人类皮肤细胞显示出增强的生存能力，而抗生素耐药性细菌被完全根除。”不管理超级细菌的后果很高。 抗药性微生物每年已经夺去了数百万人的生命，给全球经济带来数万亿美元的损失。“这项技术非常有前途，正在引起全世界科学家的关注，”普雷斯蒂奇教授说。“下一步是开始临床试验，并进一步开发这项技术，使其在诊所可用。在资助机构的支持下，我们希望澳大利亚人能尽快获得这项技术。” ", "content_en": "Next-generation, light-activated nanotech for antibiotic-resistant superbugsIt's \"lights out\" for antibiotic-resistant superbugs as next-generation light-activated nanotech proves it can eradicate some of the most notorious and potentially deadly bacteria in the world.Developed by the University of South Australia and published in Pharmaceutics, the new light therapy can eliminate antibiotic-resistant superbugs golden staph and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 500,000-fold and 100,000-fold respectively.Golden staph (staphylococcus aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are among the most deadly superbugs in the world.

But Trevor Thornton, a professor of electrical engineering in Arizona State University’s School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering (part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering), is leading a team researching the use of two new transistor materials: diamond and boron nitride (BN).Thornton’s team is conducting its research through ASU’s Advanced Materials, Processes, and Energy Devices Science and Technology Center (AMPED STC). AMPED’s goal is to develop materials and technologies with industry partners to support the mission of Arizona’s New Economy Initiative, which aims to improve Arizona’s competitiveness in developing advanced technology. AMPED specifically looks to develop technologies and materials used in the construction of batteries, solar electricity generation and power electronics.The research team includes Thornton and other ASU faculty members including Terry Alford, a professor of materials science and engineering, Stephen Goodnick, a professor of electrical engineering, and Robert Nemanich, a Regents Professor of physics, as well as doctoral students in electrical engineering and materials science and engineering. They are working with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems as the industry partner for the project.Diamond efficiency shinesThornton says that diamond is under investigation as a material for transistors because of its high thermal conductivity compared with existing materials, e.g. 8–10 times greater than gallium nitride. Harnessing diamond’s full potential could shrink the size of transistors by 90%, it is reckoned.Diamond also has a high breakdown field — i.e. it can handle a high voltage relative to most materials before failure — suitable for applications that handle large amounts of power.While diamond is the team’s chosen material for the main body of a transistor, they are investigating the use of boron nitride for the transistors’ electrical contacts.Like diamond, boron nitride has a high breakdown field and high thermal conductivity. Goodnick’s role is concerned primarily with computer modeling and simulation of the use of boron nitride transistors.The team expects that, by combining their knowledge of how diamond and boron nitride work as transistor materials, they can create transistors made from both materials. The hope is that the materials complement each other and work even better together than individually.“Ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor materials like diamond and boron nitride are expected to lead to more efficient energy conversion using less power with much smaller components,” Goodnick says. “This improves the future energy grid, which is essential for the ongoing transition toward renewable energy and electrification of the transportation sector.”Better heat dissipation to improve communicationThis research has applications that would be especially useful to communications technologies, says the team Many satellites run on solar power, which requires transistors to turn the electricity into a form usable by the satellite. “You can’t launch a power substation into space,” Thornton says. “Any improvement on size and weight in a satellite has a huge impact.”Another communications technology the transistors could improve is the cell-phone tower. Transistors convert power to the form needed to produce radio frequency waves that cell phones use.One of the biggest challenges faced when designing and operating cell-phone towers is keeping them cool, notes Thornton. This is especially the case in a hot environment like Phoenix.The power transistors in older cell-phone towers are typically made from silicon, while those in newer 5G systems will use gallium nitride. Thanks to its improved heat dissipation, Thornton’s team expects transistors made from diamond and boron nitride to greatly reduce the cooling power needed for cell towers, making it far easier to prevent them from overheating.Shrinking substationsWhile the project with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems focuses on communications technology, transistors made from diamond and boron nitride also have applications in power conversion for electrical systems and for the electricity grid. These more efficient materials could reduce the size requirements for electricity grid substations, which typically occupy an area of land the size of a building.Nemanich, a faculty member in the ASU Department of Physics, leads the ‘Ultra Materials for a Resilient, Smart Electricity Grid’ (ULTRA) Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) conducting research on power electronics. He also leads a lab for growing artificial diamond materials, which will be used by Thornton’s team in their research.“We have been growing diamond for electronic devices for the last 10 years,” Nemanich says. “Our diamond deposition lab has unique capabilities for the development of electronic materials and devices,” he believes.Interdisciplinary effortIn addition to Thornton’s electrical engineering expertise and Nemanich’s work with diamond as an electronic material, Alford, a faculty member in the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy (part of the Fulton Schools), provides his expertise on materials science.Alford is working on materials characterization, analyzing the properties of the materials that the team is investigating. He also leads a part of the research looking into the use of new types of metallic electrical contacts connected to diamond as a substrate, and he co-advises a materials science and engineering doctoral student involved in the research with Thornton.Working with Thornton’s team at the AMPED STC has given Alford the chance to conduct research that differs from his normal topics. He believes that his perspective as a materials scientist can help the team to achieve its goals. “We bring to the table a desire to understand the impact of a material’s defects,” Alford says. “We want to be able to understand those defects and how they impact a device’s performance.”Looking to the future of electronicsThe transistor research project is funded for two years through the AMPED STC partnership with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems.

This memory, presented in a paper in Science, could pave the way towards the creation of scalable quantum networks.Quantum networks are systems that can distribute entangled quantum bits, or qubits, to users who are in different geographic locations. While passing through the networks, qubits are typically encoded as photons (i.e., single particles of light).\"These qubits need to be routed and processed, both to distribute them to different users and to overcome the distance limitations imposed by the transmission loss in fiber optics,\" David Levonian, quantum research scientist at AWS, told Phys.org. \"A quantum memory is a small quantum computer that can catch and store quantum bits that are encoded in photons without measuring them, as measuring them would destroy any entanglement that they have. The stored quantum bits can be processed and reencoded in photons if necessary.\"So far, physicists and engineers have proposed several different systems that could act as quantum memory that would enable the implementation of quantum networks, such as dilute atomic gases and rare earth ions embedded in glass. The system created by Levonian and his colleagues relies on so-called silicon-vacancy centers (SiVs). These are quantum bits that are made up of electrons around single silicon atoms, embedded in diamond crystals.\"We build guides for photons that can concentrate them near our SiVs and boost the interaction of light with the electrons,\" Levonian said. \"At the end of the day, our system resembles the optical modulators that transmit most internet traffic. Like the optical modulators, our quantum memories are switches that either transmit or reflect light depending on whether they're 'on' or 'off.' Unlike normal modulators, ours are switched on and off by a single electron, rather than large electrical signals, and can be in a quantum superposition of on and off.\"The researchers' study had two primary objectives. The first was to explore the possibility of using the magnetic fields of individual nuclei as quantum memories with longer lifetimes (i.e., that can store information for longer). The second was to create a quantum memory that could operate at higher temperatures.\"Our study's first objective is a common one in our subfield of solid-state quantum memories,\" Levonian said. \"Basically, electron spins are very convenient for interacting with photons, but also sensitive to magnetic and electric fields. This sensitivity reduces their coherence times, which has motivated researchers to look at ways to transfer quantum information from electrons to more inert nuclear spins. In our paper, we looked at transferring to quantum information to the spin of the silicon atom that forms the SiV.\"To achieve their second objective, that of operating their quantum memory at higher temperatures than those reported so far, the researchers had to devise strategies that would reduce their SiVs' sensitivity to phonons (i.e., thermal vibrations in the diamond lattice), as phonons can scramble quantum bits encoded in the SiV. Past physics studies predicted that an SiV in a squeezed or \"strained\" crystal should be less sensitive to phonons.This prediction was also confirmed by previous experiments, utilizing squeezed SiVs based on unstructured diamond. Levonian and his colleagues wished to reproduce this previously reported effect in their SiV-based quantum memory.\"In the end, we were able to achieve both of our objectives—we were able to catch and store photons at 4 degrees Kelvin, instead of the 0.1 degrees that previous experiments had operated at, and we were able to take the information from photons we had stored on the electron, swap it to the silicon nucleus and store it about 1,000X longer,\" Levonian said. \"In the field of possible quantum memories, our technology represents a happy medium on many axes.\"The quantum memory created by this team of researchers can \"hold on\" to a quantum bit for a couple of milliseconds, which is a relatively long coherence time, although not the longest reported in the literature so far. Similarly, it can process local quantum information without errors 99% of the time, which is better than many platforms but worse than the very best.\"Where our memory really shines is in its efficiency at gathering up and storing photons—currently around 50% and soon to improve even more,\" Levonian explained. \"Another important feature is that it is a 'heralded' quantum memory—it gives a signal when it catches a photon. This ends up being crucial for designing efficient quantum networks.\"While the new quantum memory's ability to operate at 4 degrees Kelvin instead of 0.1 degrees Kelvin (as previously proposed devices) might not seem like a huge step forward, it could have significant consequences for the future large-scale implementations of quantum networks. In fact, cryogenic refrigerators that can bring the temperature down to 4 Kelvin are about 5 times cheaper and 10 times smaller than refrigerators that cool objects down to 0.1K, and can also fit in a server rack.\"Getting to 0.1 Kelvin requires a dilution fridge (the 'golden chandelier' that readers might have seen in articles on quantum computing), and the relatively rare and expensive Helium 3 isotope,\" Levonian added. \"Our success in this study came partly from luck, as we discovered that one of our devices had become quite strained during our manufacturing process, which let us test the temperature resilience this imparted to the SiVs. To use our discovery to build commercial devices, we need to find a way to make strained SiVs 100% of the time, which is something we're actively working on.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国哈佛大学的研究人员开发出能够进行错误检测，并且寿命超过2秒的量子存储器。量子存储器是一种小型量子计算机，在无需进行测量的同时可以捕获和存储以光子编码的量子位。该团队创建出一个依赖于硅空位中心的系统，即由嵌入金刚石晶体中的单个硅原子周围电子组成的量子位，他们首先将量子信息转移到形成硅空位中心的硅原子自旋上，再利用电子自旋对光子的相互作用和对磁场及电场的敏感性来找到将量子信息从电子转移到具有惰性气体核的自旋上。测试结果显示，该量子存储器能够在4开尔文度下捕获和存储光子，并且能够从光子中获取此前已经存储在电子上的信息，并将其交换到硅核上，延长了约1000倍的存储时间。相比于传统的存储器，该组研究人员创建出的量子存储器可以保持一个相对较长的相干时间，且在99%的时间内准确地处理本地量子信息。该研究促进了量子技术的创新发展，为开发出下一代新型量子存储器提供了更好的技术支持。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-scalable-quantum-memory-lifetime-seconds.html"}, {"title": "巴西开发了能产生两束量子纠缠光束的光源", "keyword": "量子纠缠 光学参数振荡器 非线性光学响应晶体", "content_zh": "研究人员开发了一种能产生两束纠缠光的光源科学家们越来越多地研究量子纠缠，当两个或更多的系统以这样一种方式被创建或相互作用时，其中一些系统的量子态不能独立于其他系统的量子态来描述。 这些系统是相关的，即使它们相隔很远。 在加密、通信和量子计算方面的巨大应用潜力刺激了研究。 在巴西圣保罗大学物理研究所（IF-USP）原子与光相干操纵实验室(LMCAL)的最新研究中，研究人员成功开发了一种能产生两束纠缠光束的光源。 他们的工作发表在《物理评论快报》上。“这种光源是一种光学参量振荡器，或OPO，通常由形成光学腔的两个镜子之间的非线性光学响应晶体组成。 物理学家汉斯·马林·弗洛雷斯（Hans Marin Florez）说：“当一束明亮的绿色光束照射在仪器上时，晶体镜动力学会产生两束具有量子相关性的光束。”问题是，晶体基OPOS发出的光不能与量子信息背景下的其他感兴趣的系统相互作用，如冷原子、离子或芯片，因为它的波长与所讨论的系统的波长不一样。“我们小组在以前的工作中表明，原子本身可以用作介质，而不是晶体。 因此，我们产生了第一个基于铷原子的OPO，其中两束是高度量子相关的，并获得了一个可以与其他有潜力用作量子存储器的系统相互作用的源，如冷原子，“弗洛雷斯说。然而，这不足以表明光束是纠缠的。 除了光强外，光束的相位与光波同步有关，还需要显示量子关联。 “这正是我们在《物理评论快报》上报道的新研究中取得的成果，”他说，“我们重复了同样的实验，但增加了新的检测步骤，使我们能够测量所产生的场的振幅和相位的量子相关性。 结果，我们能够显示他们是纠缠在一起的。 此外，探测技术使我们能够观察到纠缠结构比通常描述的更丰富。 我们实际上产生了一个由四个纠缠的光谱带组成的系统，而不是两个相邻的光谱带纠缠在一起。“在这种情况下，波的振幅和相位是纠缠在一起的。 这是处理和传输量子编码信息的许多协议的基础。 除了这些可能的应用之外，这种光源还可以用于计量学。 Florez说：“强度的量子关联导致强度波动的大幅减少，这可以提高光学传感器的灵敏度。” “想象一下，在一个聚会上，每个人都在说话，你听不到房间另一边的人。如果噪音足够小，如果每个人都停止说话，你可以从很远的地方听到某人说的话。”他补充说，提高用于测量人脑发射的α波的原子磁强计的灵敏度是潜在的应用之一。这篇文章还指出了铷OPOS比晶体OPOS的另一个优势。 弗洛雷斯说：“晶体OPOS必须有镜子，使光在腔内保持更长时间，这样相互作用就产生了量子相关光束，而使用原子介质比晶体更有效地产生两束光，避免了镜子将光囚禁这么长时间的需要。”在他的小组进行这项研究之前，其他小组曾试图用原子制造OPOS，但未能证明产生的光束中的量子相关性。 新的实验表明，系统中没有内在的限制来防止这种情况的发生。 “我们发现原子的温度是观察量子相关性的关键。显然，其他研究使用了更高的温度，这阻止了研究人员观察相关性，”他说。 ", "content_en": "Researchers develop a light source that produces two entangled light beamsScientists are increasingly studying quantum entanglement, which occurs when two or more systems are created or interact in such a manner that the quantum states of some cannot be described independently of the quantum states of the others. The systems are correlated, even when they are separated by a large distance. The significant potential for applications in encryption, communications and quantum computing spurs research. The difficulty is that when the systems interact with their surroundings, they almost immediately become disentangled.In the latest study by the Laboratory for Coherent Manipulation of Atoms and Light (LMCAL) at the University of S?o Paulo's Physics Institute (IF-USP) in Brazil, the researchers succeeded in developing a light source that produced two entangled light beams. Their work is published in Physical Review Letters.\"This light source was an optical parametric oscillator, or OPO, which is typically made up of a non-linear optical response crystal between two mirrors forming an optical cavity. When a bright green beam shines on the apparatus, the crystal-mirror dynamics produces two light beams with quantum correlations,\" said physicist Hans Marin Florez, last author of the article.The problem is that light emitted by crystal-based OPOs cannot interact with other systems of interest in the context of quantum information, such as cold atoms, ions or chips, since its wavelength is not the same as those of the systems in question. \"Our group showed in previous work that atoms themselves could be used as a medium instead of a crystal. We therefore produced the first OPO based on rubidium atoms, in which two beams were intensely quantum-correlated, and obtained a source that could interact with other systems with the potential to serve as quantum memory, such as cold atoms,\" Florez said.However, this was not sufficient to show the beams were entangled. In addition to the intensity, the beams' phases, which have to do with light wave synchronization, also needed to display quantum correlations. \"That's precisely what we achieved in the new study reported in Physical Review Letters,\" he said.\"We repeated the same experiment but added new detection steps that enabled us to measure the quantum correlations in the amplitudes and phases of the fields generated. As a result, we were able to show they were entangled. Furthermore, the detection technique enabled us to observe that the entanglement structure was richer than would typically be characterized. Instead of two adjacent bands of the spectrum being entangled, what we had actually produced was a system comprising four entangled spectral bands.\"In this case, the amplitudes and phases of the waves were entangled. This is fundamental in many protocols to process and transmit quantum-coded information. Besides these possible applications, this kind of light source could also be used in metrology. \"Quantum correlations of intensity result in a considerable reduction of intensity fluctuations, which can enhance the sensitivity of optical sensors,\" Florez said. \"Imagine a party where everyone is talking and you can't hear someone on the other side of the room. If the noise decreases sufficiently, if everyone stops talking, you can hear what someone says from a good distance away.\"Enhancing the sensitivity of atomic magnetometers used to measure the alpha waves emitted by the human brain is one of the potential applications, he added.The article also notes an additional advantage of rubidium OPOs over crystal OPOs. \"Crystal OPOs have to have mirrors that keep the light inside the cavity for longer, so that the interaction produces quantum correlated beams, whereas the use of an atomic medium in which the two beams are produced more efficiently than with crystals avoids the need for mirrors to imprison the light for such a long time,\" Florez said.Before his group conducted this study, other groups had tried to make OPOs with atoms but failed to demonstrate quantum correlations in the light beams produced. The new experiment showed there was no intrinsic limit in the system to prevent this from happening. \"We discovered that the temperature of the atoms is key to observation of quantum correlations. Apparently, the other studies used higher temperatures that prevented the researchers from observing correlations,\" he said.", "abstract": "近日，巴西圣保罗大学物理研究所的研究人员成功开发了一种可以产生两束量子纠缠光束的光源。该光源是一个光学参数振荡器，通常由形成光学腔的两个镜子之间的非线性光学响应组成。然而由于目前基于晶体的光学参数振荡器所发出的光无法与量子信息背景下其他的系统相互作用，因此该团队生产了第一个基于铷原子的光学参数振荡器，其中两束光具有强烈的量子相关性，并获得了一个可以与其他系统相互作用的源，但这还不足以表明光束发生了纠缠。为此，该团队在进行重复实验的过程中增加了新的检测步骤，使其能够测量所生成的场的振幅和相位中的量子相关性。实验结果表明，光束是纠缠在一起的。此外，该检测技术也让研究人员能够观察到纠缠结构比通常所描述的更丰富。研究人员还指出了铷光学参数振荡器相对于晶体光学参数振荡器更有效。该研究促进了量子技术的发展，拓展了量子纠缠在处理和传输量子编码信息协议和计量学方面的应用范围。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-source-entangled.html"}, {"title": "韩国受人体肌肉启发开发了一种单纤维致动器", "keyword": "单纤维致动器 液晶弹性体材料 石墨烯 ", "content_zh": "受人类肌肉启发的单个纤维驱动器有效地复制了人类和动物的动作，机器人应该集成类似肌肉的结构。 这些人工肌肉应该在所有相关的驱动参数中获得最佳性能，包括能量密度、应变、应力和机械强度。KAIST和韩国釜山国立大学的研究人员最近开发了一种机器人应用驱动器，受到哺乳动物骨骼和肌肉结构的启发。 《自然·纳米技术》发表的一篇论文介绍了这种驱动器，它基于具有强收缩驱动特性的软纤维。“我是在与论文合著者之一Suk Kyun Ahn教授的学术会议上了解液晶弹性体(LCE)驱动器的，”开展这项研究的研究人员之一Sang Ouk Kim告诉Phys.org。 “LCES是一种很有前途的软致动器材料，在致动时具有异常大的可逆尺寸变化（收缩/松弛），这在其他类型的致动器材料中很少观察到，但在理想地模拟自然骨骼肌行为方面非常重要。”过去开发的许多致动器都是基于LCE材料，这是一类聚合物，可以响应环境刺激迅速改变形状。 尽管LCE聚合物具有形变优势，但其力学性能相对较差，驱动行为较弱。为了克服这一限制，Kim和Ahn教授决定在LCE驱动器中加入超强石墨烯填料。 除了提高它们的机械性能之外，由于石墨烯的光热转换能力，该团队预计石墨烯填料将能够实现光驱动、快速和远程可控的驱动。金解释说：“纯LCE驱动器通常需要温度升高，这通常是一个耗时的过程，没有特定的空间可控性，以触发由液晶排列状态驱动的驱动到LCE分子的各向同性随机盘绕状态。”研究人员开发的驱动器基于软纤维，包括石墨烯填料，这些填料被精细地剥离到LCE材料的基体中。 当激光照射到光纤上时，与石墨烯填料相关的光热转换效应立即提高其周围LCE基体的温度。 这导致LCE分子从液晶排列状态转移到所谓的各向同性随机盘绕状态，最终导致纤维在宏观尺度上的长度收缩。金说：“一旦激光照明被移除，纤维恢复原始长度，而LCE矩阵瞬间冷却。” “少量(~0.3wt%)强石墨烯填料的协同掺入增强了致动器材料本身及其致动性能。石墨烯填料实现的快速光热转换也实现了可逆的、快速的高功率致动，可以通过外部光操作轻松地远程控制。”金和他的同事创建的致动器最有价值的特征之一是内部石墨烯填料网络的可逆渗滤。 这一过程允许纤维可逆地收缩和松弛回其原始尺寸，同时确保整个驱动周期的高机械强度。“纵向纤维驱动的大可逆收缩/松弛导致复合材料驱动器体积内石墨烯填料网络的可逆组装和拆卸，”金说。“这种前所未有的行为极大地加强了驱动器，尤其是在收缩的驱动状态下，并根据驱动状态带来有趣的电导率调制，这类似于自然肌肉的肌电信号生成。 值得注意的是，LCE致动器固有的机械弱点，尤其是在致动收缩状态下，一直是LCE致动器实用化的关键挑战。“研究人员在一系列测试中评估了他们的致动器，发现他们取得了非常有希望的结果。 事实上，它们展示了基于LCE材料的致动器的优势形状变形特性，同时也实现了稳健和可逆的致动应变。金说：“我们的致动器最终实现了实际有意义的致动性能，在许多方面超过了自然动物肌肉，包括致动应变、应力、能量密度和功率。” “在以前的研究中，人工肌肉有时在其中的一个或几个特征上获得了优越的性能，但与自然肌肉相比，这种全面优越的性能还没有报道。”金和他的同事最终通过在软机器人上实现它们，并评估它们在A上的性能来证明他们的驱动器的潜力。 ", "content_en": "A single fiber actuator inspired by human musclesTo effectively replicate the movements of humans and animals, robots should integrate muscle-like structures. These artificial muscles should attain an optimal performance across all relevant actuation parameters, including energy density, strain, stress, and mechanical strength.Researchers at the KAIST and Pusan National University in South Korea have recently developed an actuator for robotics applications that is inspired by mammalian skeletal and muscle structures. This actuator, introduced in a paper published in Nature Nanotechnology, is based on soft fibers with strong contractive actuation properties.\"I came to know about liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators during an academic meeting with Prof. Suk Kyun Ahn, one of the co-authors of the paper,\" Sang Ouk Kim, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"LCEs are promising soft actuator materials with unusually large reversible dimensional change (shrink/relaxation) upon actuation, which is rarely observed in other kinds of actuator materials but highly significant to ideally mimic natural skeletal muscle behavior.\"Many actuators developed in the past are based on LCE materials, a class of polymers that can rapidly change shape in response to environmental stimuli. Despite their shape-morphing advantages, LCE polymers are known to be associated with the relatively poor mechanical properties and weak actuation behavior.To overcome this limitation, Kim and Prof. Ahn decided to incorporate super-strong graphene fillers within LCE actuators. In addition to enhancing their mechanical properties, the team expected the graphene fillers to enable light-driven, rapid and remotely controllable actuation, owing to the photothermal conversion capability of graphene.\"Pure LCE actuators generally require temperature elevation, which is usually a time-consuming process without specific spatial controllability, to trigger an actuation driven by the liquid crystal aligned state to isotropic random coiled state of LCE molecules,\" Kim explained.The actuators developed by the researchers are based on soft fibers and include graphene fillers that are finely exfoliated into the LCE material's matrix. When a laser light is applied on the fiber, the photothermal conversion effect associated with the graphene filler instantly increases the temperature of its surrounding LCE matrix. This results LCE molecules to shift from a liquid crystal aligned state to a so-called isotropic random coiled state, ultimately causing the fibers to shrink in length at a macroscopic scale.\"Once the laser illumination is removed, the fiber restores the original length while LCE matrix is instantaneously cooled down,\" Kim said. \"The synergistic incorporation of a minor portion (~0.3 wt%) of strong graphene fillers strengthens the actuator material itself as well as its actuation performance. Rapid photothermal conversion enabled by graphene fillers also attains reversible, rapid high-power actuation, which can be easily remote-controllable by external light manipulation.\"One of the most valuable characteristics of the actuator created by Kim and his colleagues is the reversible percolation of the graphene filler network inside it. This process allows the fibers to be reversibly shrunk and relaxed back into their original size, while ensuring the high mechanical strength over the entire actuation cycle.\"The large reversible shrink/relaxation of longitudinal fiber actuation induces reversible assembly & disassembly of graphene filler network within the composite actuator volume,\" Kim said.\"This unprecedented behavior greatly strengthens the actuator, particularly in the shrunken actuated state and brings about the intriguing modulation of electrical conductivity depending on actuation state, which is similar to the EMG signal generation of natural muscles. Noticeably, the inherent mechanical weakness of LCE actuator particularly in the actuated shrunken state has been the longstanding critical challenge for the practical utilization of LCE actuators.\"The researchers evaluated their actuator in a series of tests and found that they achieved highly promising results. In fact, they exhibited both the advantageous shape-morphing properties of actuators based on LCE materials, while also enabling a robust and reversible actuation strain.\"Our actuator eventually achieves a practically meaningful actuation performance, which surpasses that of natural animal muscles in many ways, including actuation strain, stress, energy density and power,\" Kim said. \"Artificial muscles presented in previous works sometimes attained superior performances in one or a few of those characteristics, but there has been no report for this kind of all-round superior performance compared to natural muscle yet.\"Kim and his colleagues finally demonstrated the potential of their actuators by implementing them on soft robots and assessing their performance on a series of tasks. They found that the robots were able to imitate different human and animal movements, for instance lifting a 1kg dumbbell, bending individual fingers on an artificial hand, and reproducing the movement of inchworms.Interestingly, the team tested a robotic inchworm based on their actuator by having it \"race\" with a live inchworm. Their system won the race, further highlighting the potential of their single fiber-based actuator for creating super strong and highly performing robots, bionic prosthetic tools and perhaps even reconfigurable smart clothing.\"The next big challenge will be to integrate our artificial muscle with neural activity,\" Kim added. \"If individual actuator fiber is specifically controllable mimicking neutral control, natural animal like sophisticated movements and locomotion should be possible while interfaced with human brain or AI. Currently, most actuators rely on hard mechanical systems. Our composite soft actuator would be a promising candidate to the address the inherent limitations of traditional mechanical actuation system, such as heavy weight and mechanical rigidity, and to attain truly natural animal like soft robotics.\"", "abstract": "近日，韩国釜山国立大学的研究人员开发了一种用于机器人应用的致动器，其灵感来自哺乳动物的骨骼和肌肉结构。过去开发的许多致动器都是基于液晶弹性体材料（LCE），该材料是一类可以响应环境刺激而迅速改变形状的聚合物，但LCE聚合物的机械性能较差。为了克服这一限制，研究人员在LCE致动器中加入了超强石墨烯填料，除了增强其机械性能外，由于石墨烯具有光热转换能力，还使得石墨烯填料能够实现光驱动，而且是快速和可远程控制的光驱动。同时，该致动器内部石墨烯填充网络具有可逆渗透性，允许纤维可逆地收缩并松弛回其原始尺寸，并确保在整个驱动周期内具有高机械强度。该研究有效地复制了人类和动物的运动，使得机器也可以整合类似肌肉的结构。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-fiber-actuator-human-muscles.html"}, {"title": "德国基于氮化镓技术开发出新型垂直功率晶体管", "keyword": "垂直功率晶体管 宽带隙半导体 氮化镓", "content_zh": "硅成本宽禁带功率：项目开发具有竞争力的GaN工艺技术我们能否通过以低成本最大限度地提高功率转换效率来应对全球能源挑战？ 答案是：是的！ YESVGaN联盟的目标是创建一种基于氮化镓（GaN）的新型垂直功率晶体管，即所谓的垂直GaN薄膜晶体管，这些新型功率器件结合了宽禁带(WBG)半导体的效率和现有硅半导体技术的低成本。 在YESVGAN内部，涵盖了从晶圆到应用的所有所需新技术的开发。自2021年5月1日项目启动以来，由23个欧洲合作伙伴组成的项目联盟取得了令人印象深刻的发展。 采用FinFET结构和肖特基二极管的垂直器件演示器--这是一种新型垂直薄膜晶体管技术的重要组成部分--已经成功创建。 此外，在硅和蓝宝石衬底上生长了二极管击穿电压超过500伏的垂直层堆叠，这是在低成本硅或蓝宝石衬底上达到1200伏阻断电压的总体项目目标的重要一步。 因此，GaN半导体材料在未来的高性能应用中，如汽车工业中，可以进入市场。对于背侧接触的超低电阻贡献的垂直GaN功率晶体管，开发可靠的膜工艺技术至关重要。 YESVGaN已经成功地制造出厚度为几微米、直径为几毫米的易碎GaN薄膜，并且没有破裂。新的组装和互连技术正在测试中，以便在极端条件下最终应用于薄膜垂直GaN功率晶体管。 这包括超过250℃的操作温度。 此外，我们正在开发虚拟样机，以评估使用数字孪生器件在目标应用中的效率。我们相信YESVGaN将在项目的下一阶段继续取得有希望的结果，并朝着全垂直GaN薄膜晶体管迈出重要一步。由Fraunhofer-Intitut Für Integrierte Systeme und Bauelementetechnologie IISB提供。 ", "content_en": "Wide-bandgap power at silicon cost: Project develops competitive GaN process technologiesCan we contribute to the worldwide energy challenge by maximizing the efficiency in power conversion at a low cost?

Similar phenomena can be seen in the natural world, like in flower petals and tree branches. But where these structures have extraordinary potential is at a level beyond the visibility of the human eye—at the nanoscale.Using conventional methods, scientists have found it challenging to replicate these 3D structures with metal components on the nanoscale. To understand just how small these tiny 3D materials need to be—in one centimeter, there are 10 millimeters. If you were to count one million tiny segments in just one of those millimeters, each of those would be one nanometre or nm.\"To date, scientists have been able to assemble hierarchical-type structures on the micrometer or molecular scale,\" says Professor Richard Tilley, Director of the Electron Microscope Unit at UNSW and senior author of the study. \"But to get the level of precision needed to assemble on the nanoscale, we needed to develop an entirely new bottom-up methodology.\"The researchers used chemical synthesis, an approach that constructs complex chemical compounds from simpler ones. They were able to carefully grow hexagonal crystal–structured nickel branches on cubic crystal–structured cores to create 3D hierarchical structures with dimensions of around 10–20 nanometers.The resulting interconnected 3D nanostructure has a high surface area, high conductivity due to the direct connection of a metallic core and branches, and has surfaces that can be chemically modified. These properties make it an ideal electrocatalyst support—a substance that helps speed up the rate of reactions—in the oxygen evolution reaction, a crucial process in energy conversion. The nanostructure's properties were examined using electrochemical analysis from state-of-the-art electron microscopes provided by the Electron Microscope Unit.\"Growing the material step by step is a contrast to what we do assembling structures at the micrometer level, which is starting with bulk material and etching it down,\" says the lead author of the study Dr. Lucy Gloag, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Chemistry, UNSW Science. \"This new method allows us to have excellent control over the conditions, which lets us keep all of the components ultra-small—on the nanoscale—where the unique catalytic properties exist.\"Nanocatalysts in fuel cellsIn conventional catalysts, which are often spherical, most atoms are stuck in the middle of the sphere. There are very few atoms on the surface, meaning most of the material is wasted as it can't take part in the reaction environment.These new 3D nanostructures are engineered to expose more atoms to the reaction environment, which can facilitate more efficient and effective catalysis for energy conversion, Prof. Tilley says.\"If this is used in a fuel cell or battery, having a higher surface area for the catalyst means the reaction will be more efficient when converting hydrogen into electricity,\" Prof. Tilley says.Dr. Gloag says it means that less of the material needs to be used for the reaction.\"It will eventually decrease the costs as well, making energy production more sustainable and ultimately shifting our dependence further away from fossil fuels.\"In the next research stage, the scientists will look to modify the surface of the material with platinum, which is a superior catalytic metal though more expensive. About a sixth of the cost of an electric car alone is the platinum powering the fuel cell.\"These exceptionally high surface areas would support a material like platinum to be layered on in individual atoms, so we have the absolute best use of these expensive metals in a reaction environment,\" Prof. Tilley says.", "abstract": "近日，澳大利亚新南威尔士大学领导的研究团队研发出一种制造微小三维材料的新技术，有望提高氢电池等燃料电池的生产效率。在化学科学中，分级结构是像分子一样的单元在其他单元的组织中的配置，这些单元本身可能是有序的。类似的现象可在自然界中看到，比如花瓣和树枝。同时，这些结构还具有独特的化学和物理属性，以支持能量转换反应。迄今为止，科学家已经能够在微米或分子尺度上组装分级结构，但他们发现用纳米尺度的金属部件复制这些三维结构具有挑战性。在这项新研究中，该团队使用化学合成方法，从简单化合物中构建复杂化合物。他们能够在立方晶体结构的核心上生长六方晶体结构的镍分支，研发出尺寸约为10-20纳米的三维互联的分级结构。由于金属芯和分支的直接连接，所得的互连三维纳米结构具有高表面积和高导电性，表面还可以化学改性，这些特性使其成为理想的电催化剂载体。该研究有望降低燃料电池的制造成本，使能源生产更加可持续，并最终使我们不再依赖化石燃料。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-method-tiny-3d-materials-fuel.html"}, {"title": "挪威探索利用太阳能电池板废料制造新电池板的技术", "keyword": "太阳能电池板 硅晶体 废料回收", "content_zh": "来自太阳能电池板浪费能源的新太阳能电池板对地球来说是个好消息--但太阳能电池板并不像它们应该的那样对气候友好。 研究人员马丁·贝尔曼（Martin Bellmann）正在利用他所说的太阳能电池板制造中的“黑金”废料来制造新的电池板。太阳能是清洁能源。 纯粹而简单。 但是当涉及到获得制造太阳能电池板所需的原材料时，事情开始变得复杂起来。 这些原材料不仅大部分来自中国，而且多达三分之一的材料在制造过程中丢失。“但作为生产过程的一部分，回收这些材料是可能的，”马丁·贝尔曼说。 “也许这将使我们能够在欧洲建立一个新的太阳能产业，”他说。 Bellmann是Sintef Industry的高级商业开发人员，领导着名为ICARUS的国际太阳能电池板项目。 太阳能电池板目前占全球可再生能源增长的60%。从石英到晶体硅贝尔曼解释了太阳能电池板是如何从用于制造超纯硅的矿物石英开始的。 首先，硅在坩埚中熔化，硅晶体或锭被拉出来。“锭形成一种圆柱体，通过从坩埚中缓慢地拉出硅来不断地生长”Bellmann说。 “然后它被切割成一个正方形的块，然后被锯成薄片，或者我们研究人员称之为晶圆，”他说。典型的晶圆只有0.13毫米（13微米）厚，正是这些晶圆被用来制造太阳能面板。但是所有这些锯切都会产生大量的“锯末”粉末。 这就像锯木板一样--一些木材以木屑的形式丢失。 当你看到硅锭时也会发生同样的事情，即使你使用细金刚石线。 有些材料总是会以“硅粉”的形式丢失。锯切浪费35%“我们以黑火药的形式损失了35%的硅，”贝尔曼说。研究人员的目标是开发这种他称之为新黑金的粉末。“今天，我们只是把这种粉末扔掉，”贝尔曼说。 伊卡洛斯项目所做的，首先也是最重要的，是寻找将粉末返回价值链的方法，并用它来制造硅晶体和太阳能电池板，“他说。粉末被收集在一种液体污泥混合物中，该混合物还包含锯切过程中的污染物，如氧、碳、镍、铁和铝被这些金属污染的硅不利于太阳能电池板的制造，” 贝尔曼说，这就是为什么他与伊卡洛斯项目的合作伙伴一起努力寻找净化硅粉的方法，以便它可以作为新太阳能电池板的原材料回收利用。 今天我们认为是废物的东西可以用于其他产品，如电动汽车电池。 许多合作伙伴正在测试从受污染的混合物中分离硅的不同方法。一个全欧洲范围的项目自然地，目的是更好地开发原材料，这反过来将有利于环境和气候。 但欧洲应该实现更大的自给自足也是一个明确的目标。“欧洲太阳能电池板行业曾经比现在更大，但一切都转移到了中国，”贝尔曼说。 “今天，我们严重依赖来自亚洲的原材料，硅也不例外。我们计划使用硅粉来帮助减少我们对中国的依赖，”他说。贝尔曼希望伊卡洛斯研究项目将为一个新行业奠定基础，也许也是在挪威。 挪威的能源是清洁的，这是这种情况下的一个主要优势。回收硅，伊卡洛斯项目带来的另一个好处是，研究人员计划回收用于在硅被拉成晶体之前冶炼硅的石英坩埚。“坩埚在熔炉中冷却时会破裂，”贝尔曼说。 “每次你冶炼一些石英，你都必须得到一个新的坩埚，然后扔掉旧的坩埚。我们的目标是将其作为制造碳化硅的原料，”他说。碳化硅被用于电子工业等，电动汽车只是含有这种材料的许多产品之一。“通常，我们使用所谓的高纯度石英来制造碳化硅，但这非常昂贵，”贝尔曼说。 “我们的想法是，有可能用坩埚废料取代高纯度石英，坩埚废料本质上也是非常高纯度的石英，”他说。伊卡洛斯项目也在研究回收石墨废料，作为电池等的原材料。“高纯度石墨也被丢弃，”贝尔曼说。 “它被用于烘箱中，在那里硅晶体被取出，但由于它失去了它的特性，必须不时更换。伊卡洛斯项目目前正在处理石墨废料，目的是回收利用它，”他说。 ", "content_en": "New solar panels from solar panel wasteSolar energy is good news for planet Earth—but solar panels are not as climate-friendly as they should be. Researcher Martin Bellmann is using what he calls the \"black gold\" waste materials from solar panel manufacture to make new panels.Solar energy is clean energy. Pure and simple. But things start to get complicated when it comes to obtaining the raw materials we need to make solar panels. Not only do most of these raw materials come from China, but as much as a third of the material is lost during the manufacturing process.\"But it's possible to recover this material as part of the production process,\" says Martin Bellmann. \"And maybe this will enable us to establish a new solar-based industry in Europe,\" he says. Bellmann is a Senior Business Developer at SINTEF Industry and is heading the international solar panel project called Icarus. Solar panels currently represent 60% of global growth in renewable energy.From quartz to crystalline siliconBellmann explains how solar panels begin with the mineral quartz, which is used to make super-pure silicon. First, the silicon is melted in a crucible and a silicon crystal, or ingot, is pulled out.\"The ingot forms a kind of cylinder that grows and grows by slowly pulling the silicon from the crucible\" says Bellmann. \"It is then cut to form a square-sided block which is sawn into thin slices, or wafers, as we researchers call them,\" he says.A typical wafer is just 0.13 millimeters (13 micrometers) thick, and it is these wafers that are used to make solar panels.But all this sawing results in a great deal of \"sawdust\" powder. It's just like sawing a timber plank—some of the timber is lost in the form of sawdust. The same thing happens when you saw through a silicon ingot, even if you use thin diamond wires. Some material will always be lost as \"silicon powder.\"Sawing wastes 35%\"We lose 35% of the silicon in the form of a black powder,\" says Bellmann.It is this powder, which he calls the new black gold, that the researchers are aiming to exploit.\"Today, we simply throw this powder away,\" says Bellmann. What the Icarus project is doing, first and foremost, is looking into ways to return the powder to the value chain and use it to make silicon crystals and solar panels,\" he says.The powder is collected in a liquid sludge mixture that also contains contaminants from the sawing process such as oxygen, carbon, nickel, iron and aluminum.\"Silicon contaminated by these metals is not good for solar panel manufacture,\" says BellmanThis is why he is working together with Icarus project partners to find ways of decontaminating the silicon powder so that it can be recycled as a raw material for new solar panels. What today we regard as waste can be used in other products such as electric vehicle batteries. A number of partners are testing different ways of separating silicon from the contaminated mixture.A Europe-wide projectNaturally, the aim is to better exploit the raw material, which in turn will be good for the environment and the climate. But it is also a stated aim that Europe should achieve greater self-sufficiency.\"The European solar panel sector was once bigger than it is now, but everything has been moved to China,\" says Bellmann. \"Today, we're heavily reliant on raw materials from Asia, and silicon is no exception. We're planning to use the silicon powder to help reduce our dependency on China,\" he says.Bellmann is hoping that the Icarus research project will form the basis for a new industry, perhaps also in Norway. Norwegian energy is clean, and this is a major advantage in this context.Recycling silicon, and moreA bonus resulting from the Icarus project is that researchers are planning to recycle the quartz crucibles that are used to smelt the silicon before it is pulled into crystals.\"The crucibles fracture when they cool down in the smelting oven,\" says Bellmann. \"Every time you smelt some quartz you have to get a new crucible and throw the old one away. Our aim is to use this as a raw material for making silicon carbide,\" he says.Silicon carbide is used in the electronics industry, among others, and electric vehicles are just one of many products that contain the material.\"Normally, we use so-called high-purity quartz to make silicon carbide, but this is very expensive,\" says Bellmann. \"Our idea is that it might be possible to replace high-purity quartz with crucible waste, which is also in essence quartz of very high purity,\" he says.The Icarus project is also looking into recycling graphite waste as a raw material for use in batteries, among others.\"High-purity graphite is also discarded,\" says Bellmann. \"It is used in the ovens where the silicon crystals are pulled out but has to be replaced from time to time because it loses its properties. The Icarus project is currently working with graphite waste, with the aim of recycling it,\" he says.", "abstract": "近日，挪威科技工业研究所致力于利用太阳能电池板制造过程中产生的废料，以制造新的电池板。太阳能电池板以矿物石英为起始材料，这种材料可用于制造超纯硅。首先，将硅在坩埚中熔化，然后拉出硅晶体或硅锭。从坩埚中缓慢地拉出硅来，硅锭会逐渐形成圆柱体，然后将其切割成方形块，再锯成薄片，就是所谓的晶片。但是，如同锯木板一样，在晶片的生产过程中会产生大量的“锯末”。这个过程以黑粉末的形式损失了35%的硅。这些粉末被收集在淤泥状混合物中，其中还含有锯切过程中产生的污染物，如氧、碳、镍、铁和铝。使用被这些金属污染的硅，不利于生产太阳能电池板。因此，研究团队寻找从硅粉中去除杂质的方法，以将其回收为制造新太阳能电池板的原材料。这些材料可用于电动汽车电池等产品。该项目旨在更好地开发原材料，有利于环境和气候可持续发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-solar-panels-panel.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出能提高零件三维打印效率的深度学习框架", "keyword": "三维打印 X射线 计算机断层扫描", "content_zh": "深度学习使3D打印零件的X射线CT检查更快、更准确。能源部橡树岭国家实验室开发的新深度学习框架正在加快使用X射线计算机断层扫描或CT检查额外制造的金属零件的过程，同时提高结果的准确性。 时间、劳动力、维护和能源成本的降低预计将加快增材制造或3D打印的扩张。“扫描速度显著降低了成本，”ORNL首席研究员阿米尔·齐阿巴里说。 “质量更高，所以后处理分析变得简单得多。”该框架已经被纳入商业合作伙伴蔡司在美国能源部位于ORNL的制造示范设施的机器中使用的软件，公司在那里磨练3D打印方法。ORNL的研究人员此前开发了可以在打印时分析零件质量的技术。 在打印后增加高水平的成像精度，为增材制造提供了额外的信任度，同时有可能增加产量。蔡司增材制造业务发展经理普拉迪普·巴塔德（Pradeep Bhattad）表示：“有了这一点，我们可以检查3D打印机中的每一个零件。” “目前CT仅限于原型制造。但这一工具可以推动增材制造走向工业化。”X射线CT扫描对于证明3D打印零件的可靠性而不损坏它很重要。 其过程类似于医用X线CT。 在这种情况下，橱柜内的一个物体被缓慢旋转，并被强大的X射线以每个角度扫描。 计算机算法使用得到的二维投影堆叠来构造显示物体内部结构密度的3D图像。 X射线CT可以用来检测缺陷、分析故障或证明产品符合预期的成分和质量，但由于当前的扫描和分析方法耗时长且不精确，因此X射线CT在增材制造中没有得到大规模应用。 金属可以完全吸收X射线束中的低能量X射线，造成图像不准确，如果物体具有复杂的形状，这种不准确会进一步增加。 由此产生的图像缺陷可能会掩盖扫描意图揭示的裂缝或孔隙。 训练有素的技术人员可以在分析过程中纠正这些问题，但这个过程耗时耗力。Ziabari和他的团队开发了一个深度学习框架，可以快速提供更清晰、更准确的重建和自动化分析。 他将在10月份的电气和电子工程师协会图像处理国际会议上展示他的团队开发的过程。为CT训练一个有监督的深度学习网络通常需要许多昂贵的测量。 由于金属部件带来了额外的挑战，获得适当的训练数据可能很困难。 Ziabari的方法提供了一个飞跃，通过生成现实的训练数据，而不需要大量的实验来收集它。生成对抗网络，或GAN方法，被用来综合创建一个现实的数据集，用于训练神经网络，利用基于物理的模拟和计算机辅助设计。 GAN是一种机器学习，它利用神经网络相互竞争，就像在游戏中一样。 Ziabari说，它很少用于这样的实际应用。Ziabari说，因为这种X射线CT框架需要更少角度的扫描才能达到精度，它已经将成像时间减少了6倍--从大约1小时减少到10分钟或更少。 在如此少的视角下快速工作通常会给3D图像增加显著的“噪声”。 但是在训练数据上教授的ORNL算法纠正了这一点，甚至将小缺陷检测提高了四倍或更多。Ziabari团队开发的框架将允许制造商快速微调他们的构建，即使在改变设计或材料的同时。 Bhattad说，通过这种方法，样本分析可以在一天内完成，而不是六到八周。“如果我能以非常经济有效的方式非常迅速地检查整个部分，那么我们有100%的信心，”他说。 “我们正在与ORNL合作，使CT成为一个可访问和可靠的行业检查工具。”ORNL的研究人员使用复杂、致密的材料，在数百个打印了不同扫描参数的样本上评估了新框架的性能。 Bhattad说，这些结果很好，MDF正在进行的试验正在努力验证这项技术对任何类型的金属合金都同样有效。这很重要，因为Ziabari团队开发的方法可以使认证由新金属合金制成的零件变得更加容易。 “人们不使用新颖的材料，因为他们不知道最好的印刷参数，”齐亚巴里说。 “现在，如果你能这样描述这些材料 ", "content_en": "Deep learning makes X-ray CT inspection of 3D-printed parts faster, more accurateA new deep-learning framework developed at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory is speeding up the process of inspecting additively manufactured metal parts using X-ray computed tomography, or CT, while increasing the accuracy of the results. The reduced costs for time, labor, maintenance and energy are expected to accelerate expansion of additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.\"The scan speed reduces costs significantly,\" said ORNL lead researcher Amir Ziabari. \"And the quality is higher, so the post-processing analysis becomes much simpler.\"The framework is already being incorporated into software used by commercial partner ZEISS within its machines at DOE's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL, where companies hone 3D-printing methods.ORNL researchers had previously developed technology that can analyze the quality of a part while it is being printed. Adding a high level of imaging accuracy after printing provides an additional level of trust in additive manufacturing while potentially increasing production.\"With this, we can inspect every single part coming out of 3D-printing machines,\" said Pradeep Bhattad, ZEISS business development manager for additive manufacturing. \"Currently CT is limited to prototyping. But this one tool can propel additive manufacturing toward industrialization.\"X-ray CT scanning is important for certifying the soundness of a 3D-printed part without damaging it. The process is similar to medical X-ray CT. In this case, an object set inside a cabinet is slowly rotated and scanned at each angle by powerful X-rays. Computer algorithms use the resulting stack of two-dimensional projections to construct a 3D image showing the density of the object's internal structure. X-ray CT can be used to detect defects, analyze failures or certify that a product matches the intended composition and quality.However, X-ray CT is not used at large scale in additive manufacturing because current methods of scanning and analysis are time-intensive and imprecise. Metals can totally absorb the lower-energy X-rays in the X-ray beam, creating image inaccuracies that can be further multiplied if the object has a complex shape. The resulting flaws in the image can obscure cracks or pores the scan is intended to reveal. A trained technician can correct for these problems during analysis, but the process is time- and labor-intensive.Ziabari and his team developed a deep-learning framework that rapidly provides a clearer, more accurate reconstruction and an automated analysis. He will present the process his team developed during the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Image Processing in October.Training a supervised deep-learning network for CT usually requires many expensive measurements. Because metal parts pose additional challenges, getting the appropriate training data can be difficult. Ziabari's approach provides a leap forward by generating realistic training data without requiring extensive experiments to gather it.A generative adversarial network, or GAN, method is used to synthetically create a realistic-looking data set for training a neural network, leveraging physics-based simulations and computer-aided design. GAN is a class of machine learning that utilizes neural networks competing with each other as in a game. It has rarely been used for practical applications like this, Ziabari said.Because this X-ray CT framework needs scans with fewer angles to achieve accuracy, it has reduced imaging time by a factor of six, Ziabari said—from about one hour to 10 minutes or less. Working that quickly with so few viewing angles would normally add significant \"noise\" to the 3D image. But the ORNL algorithm taught on the training data corrects this, even enhancing small flaw detection by a factor of four or more.The framework developed by Ziabari's team would allow manufacturers to rapidly fine-tune their builds, even while changing designs or materials. With this approach, sample analysis can be completed in a day instead of six to eight weeks, Bhattad said.\"If I can very rapidly inspect the whole part in a very cost-effective way, then we have 100% confidence,\" he said. \"We are partnering with ORNL to make CT an accessible and reliable industry inspection tool.\"ORNL researchers evaluated the performance of the new framework on hundreds of samples printed with different scan parameters, using complicated, dense materials. These results were good, and ongoing trials at MDF are working to verify that the technique is equally effective with any type of metal alloy, Bhattad said.That's important, because the approach developed by Ziabari's team could make it far easier to certify parts made from new metal alloys. \"People don't use novel materials because they don't know the best printing parameters,\" Ziabari said. \"Now, if you can characterize these materials so quickly and optimize the parameters, that would help move these novel materials into additive manufacturing.\"In fact, Ziabari said, the technology can be applied in many fields, including defense, auto manufacturing, aerospace and electronics printing, as well as nondestructive evaluation of electric vehicle batteries.", "abstract": "近日，美国能源部橡树岭国家实验室(Oak Ridge National Laboratory)开发出可为三维打印提供更清晰、更准确重建和自动化分析的快速深度学习框架。该框架可在加快使用X射线计算机断层扫描(CT)检查额外制造金属零件的过程中，同时提高检查结果的准确性，降低其在时间、劳动力、维护和能源等方面的成本，从而提高零件三维打印的效率。该过程类似于医用X射线的计算机断层扫描。在此情况下，放置在柜子内的物体会缓慢旋转，并通过强大X射线在各个角度进行扫描。再由计算机算法使用生成的二维投影堆栈构建显示对象内部结构密度的三维图像，这样可以更好的检测缺陷、分析故障或证明产品符合预期的成分和质量。且该框架可在不需要大量实验收集数据的情况下生成真实的训练数据。研究人员表示该技术可应用于国防、汽车制造、航空航天和电子印刷等行业，以及电动汽车电池在内的无损评估，目前，该框架已投入到商业公司制造示范设施的机器中使用。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-deep-x-ray-ct-3d-printed-faster.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出可看到身体内部结构的贴纸", "keyword": "超声成像 超声波贴纸 可穿戴设备", "content_zh": "工程师开发了可以看到身体内部的贴纸超声成像是进入身体工作的一个安全和无创的窗口，为临床医生提供患者内脏器官的实时图像。 为了捕捉这些图像，训练有素的技术人员操纵超声波棒和探头将声波引导到身体中。 这些波反射回来，产生病人心脏、肺和其他深部器官的高分辨率图像。目前，超声成像需要体积庞大的专门设备，只有医院和医生办公室才有。 但是麻省理工学院工程师的一项新设计可能会使这项技术像在药店买创可贴一样可穿戴和容易获得。在今天发表在《科学》杂志上的一篇论文中，工程师们提出了一种新的超声波贴纸的设计--一种邮票大小的设备，粘在皮肤上，可以提供48小时的连续内脏超声成像。研究人员将贴纸应用于志愿者身上，并展示了这些设备产生的主要血管和心脏、肺和胃等深层器官的高分辨率实时图像。 当志愿者进行各种活动时，包括坐着、站着、慢跑和骑自行车，这些贴纸保持着很强的粘附力，并捕捉到底层器官的变化。目前的设计要求将贴纸连接到将反射声波转化为图像的仪器上。 研究人员指出，即使以目前的形式，这些贴纸也可以立即应用：例如，这些设备可以应用于医院的病人，类似于心脏监测EKG贴纸， 并可以在不需要技术人员长时间手持探头的情况下连续对内部器官进行成像。如果这些设备可以无线操作--这是该团队目前正在努力实现的目标--超声波贴纸可以制成可穿戴成像产品，患者可以从医生办公室带回家，甚至在药店购买。该研究的高级作者赵宣和说：“我们设想一些贴片粘在身体的不同位置，贴片将与你的手机通信，人工智能算法将根据需要分析图像。” 麻省理工学院机械工程及土木与环境工程教授。 “我们相信我们已经开启了可穿戴成像的新时代：在你身上贴上几块补丁，你就可以看到你的内脏。”这项研究还包括主要作者王崇和和陈晓宇，合著者刘旺、麻省理工学院的真田光俊和赵涛，以及明尼苏达州罗切斯特梅奥诊所的刘晓川。一个棘手的问题要用超声波成像，技术人员首先将液体凝胶涂在病人的皮肤上，这种凝胶起到传输超声波的作用。 然后，一个探头或换能器被压在凝胶上，将声波发送到体内，声波从内部结构回声回到探头，在那里回声信号被转换成视觉图像。对于需要长时间成像的患者，一些医院提供安装在机械臂上的探头，可以在不疲劳的情况下将换能器固定在适当的位置，但液体超声凝胶随着时间的推移流动并干涸，中断长期成像。近年来，研究人员探索了可伸展超声探头的设计，该探头将提供便携式、低剖面的内脏成像。 这些设计给出了一个灵活的微型超声换能器阵列，其想法是这样的设备可以伸展并与患者的身体一致。但是这些实验性设计产生了低分辨率的图像，部分原因是它们的伸展：在与身体移动时，换能器相对于彼此移动位置，扭曲了最终的图像。“可穿戴超声成像工具在未来的临床诊断中具有巨大的潜力。 然而，现有超声贴片的分辨率和成像持续时间相对较低，它们不能成像深部器官，“麻省理工学院研究生王崇和说。内部观察麻省理工学院团队的新超声贴纸通过将一层弹性粘合层与一组刚性换能器配对，在更长的时间内产生更高分辨率的图像。 “这种组合使设备能够顺应皮肤，同时保持换能器的相对位置，以生成更清晰、更精确的图像。” 该设备的粘合层由两层薄薄的弹性体制成，中间层是固体水凝胶，这是一种主要是水基材料，容易传输声波。 与传统的超声波凝胶不同，麻省理工学院团队的水凝胶具有弹性和弹性。麻省理工学院博士后陈说：“弹性体可以防止水凝胶脱水。” “只有当水凝胶高度水化时，声波才能有效穿透，并给出内脏器官的高分辨率成像。”底部的弹性体层被设计成粘附在皮肤上，而顶层粘附在团队也设计和制造的刚性换能器阵列上。 ", "content_en": "Engineers develop stickers that can see inside the bodyUltrasound imaging is a safe and noninvasive window into the body's workings, providing clinicians with live images of a patient's internal organs. To capture these images, trained technicians manipulate ultrasound wands and probes to direct sound waves into the body. These waves reflect back out to produce high-resolution images of a patient's heart, lungs, and other deep organs.Currently, ultrasound imaging requires bulky and specialized equipment available only in hospitals and doctor's offices. But a new design by MIT engineers might make the technology as wearable and accessible as buying Band-Aids at the pharmacy.In a paper appearing today in Science, the engineers present the design for a new ultrasound sticker—a stamp-sized device that sticks to skin and can provide continuous ultrasound imaging of internal organs for 48 hours.The researchers applied the stickers to volunteers and showed the devices produced live, high-resolution images of major blood vessels and deeper organs such as the heart, lungs, and stomach. The stickers maintained a strong adhesion and captured changes in underlying organs as volunteers performed various activities, including sitting, standing, jogging, and biking.The current design requires connecting the stickers to instruments that translate the reflected sound waves into images. The researchers point out that even in their current form, the stickers could have immediate applications: For instance, the devices could be applied to patients in the hospital, similar to heart-monitoring EKG stickers, and could continuously image internal organs without requiring a technician to hold a probe in place for long periods of time.If the devices can be made to operate wirelessly—a goal the team is currently working toward—the ultrasound stickers could be made into wearable imaging products that patients could take home from a doctor's office or even buy at a pharmacy.\"We envision a few patches adhered to different locations on the body, and the patches would communicate with your cellphone, where AI algorithms would analyze the images on demand,\" says the study's senior author, Xuanhe Zhao, professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering at MIT. \"We believe we've opened a new era of wearable imaging: With a few patches on your body, you could see your internal organs.\"The study also includes lead authors Chonghe Wang and Xiaoyu Chen, and co-authors Liu Wang, Mitsutoshi Makihata, and Tao Zhao at MIT, along with Hsiao-Chuan Liu of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.A sticky issueTo image with ultrasound, a technician first applies a liquid gel to a patient's skin, which acts to transmit ultrasound waves. A probe, or transducer, is then pressed against the gel, sending sound waves into the body that echo off internal structures and back to the probe, where the echoed signals are translated into visual images.For patients who require long periods of imaging, some hospitals offer probes affixed to robotic arms that can hold a transducer in place without tiring, but the liquid ultrasound gel flows away and dries out over time, interrupting long-term imaging.In recent years, researchers have explored designs for stretchable ultrasound probes that would provide portable, low-profile imaging of internal organs. These designs gave a flexible array of tiny ultrasound transducers, the idea being that such a device would stretch and conform with a patient's body.But these experimental designs have produced low-resolution images, in part due to their stretch: In moving with the body, transducers shift location relative to each other, distorting the resulting image.\"Wearable ultrasound imaging tool would have huge potential in the future of clinical diagnosis. However, the resolution and imaging duration of existing ultrasound patches is relatively low, and they cannot image deep organs,\" says Chonghe Wang, who is an MIT graduate student.An inside lookThe MIT team's new ultrasound sticker produces higher resolution images over a longer duration by pairing a stretchy adhesive layer with a rigid array of transducers. \"This combination enables the device to conform to the skin while maintaining the relative location of transducers to generate clearer and more precise images.\" Wang says.The device's adhesive layer is made from two thin layers of elastomer that encapsulate a middle layer of solid hydrogel, a mostly water-based material that easily transmits sound waves. Unlike traditional ultrasound gels, the MIT team's hydrogel is elastic and stretchy.\"The elastomer prevents dehydration of hydrogel,\" says Chen, an MIT postdoc. \"Only when hydrogel is highly hydrated can acoustic waves penetrate effectively and give high-resolution imaging of internal organs.\"The bottom elastomer layer is designed to stick to skin, while the top layer adheres to a rigid array of transducers that the team also designed and fabricated. The entire ultrasound sticker measures about 2 square centimeters across, and 3 millimeters thick—about the area of a postage stamp.The researchers ran the ultrasound sticker through a battery of tests with healthy volunteers, who wore the stickers on various parts of their bodies, including the neck, chest, abdomen, and arms. The stickers stayed attached to their skin, and produced clear images of underlying structures for up to 48 hours. During this time, volunteers performed a variety of activities in the lab, from sitting and standing, to jogging, biking, and lifting weights.From the stickers' images, the team was able to observe the changing diameter of major blood vessels when seated versus standing. The stickers also captured details of deeper organs, such as how the heart changes shape as it exerts during exercise. The researchers were also able to watch the stomach distend, then shrink back as volunteers drank then later passed juice out of their system. And as some volunteers lifted weights, the team could detect bright patterns in underlying muscles, signaling temporary microdamage.\"With imaging, we might be able to capture the moment in a workout before overuse, and stop before muscles become sore,\" says Chen. \"We do not know when that moment might be yet, but now we can provide imaging data that experts can interpret.\"The team is working to make the stickers function wirelessly. They are also developing software algorithms based on artificial intelligence that can better interpret and diagnose the stickers' images. Then, Zhao envisions ultrasound stickers could be packaged and purchased by patients and consumers, and used not only to monitor various internal organs, but also the progression of tumors, as well as the development of fetuses in the womb.\"We imagine we could have a box of stickers, each designed to image a different location of the body,\" Zhao says. \"We believe this represents a breakthrough in wearable devices and medical imaging.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国麻省理工学院研究人员开发出可看到身体内部结构的贴纸。超声成像技术能够在安全且无创的情况下为临床医生提供患者内部器官的实时图像，为捕捉这些图像技术人员操纵超声波棒和探头将声波导入体内，这些波反射回来，可产生病人心脏、肺和其他深层器官的高分辨率结构图像。但目前超声成像只能在医院庞大设备中完成。为了简化这一检测过程，研究人员开发出一种新型超声波贴纸，它的尺寸与邮票相当，可贴在皮肤表面，为内部器官提供连续48小时的超声波成像。在测试中，研究人员发现即使当志愿者进行各种活动时，这种贴纸仍然能够保持很强的粘附力，并产生人体器官的高分辨率实时图像。该研究成果有望在可穿戴设备和医学成像领域获得应用。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-07-stickers-body.html"}, {"title": "美国利用人工智能技术构建出高分辨率大脑图像", "keyword": "人工智能 核磁共振成像系统 卷积神经网络算法", "content_zh": "人工智能从低场强磁共振成像中创建高分辨率大脑图像可扫描的低场强磁共振成像系统有潜力改变神经成像--前提是它们的低空间分辨率和低信噪比可以克服。 哈佛医学院的研究人员正在利用人工智能(AI)来实现这一目标。 他们开发了一种机器学习超分辨率算法，可以从低分辨率的大脑MRI扫描中生成高空间分辨率的合成图像。卷积神经网络(CNN)算法被称为LF-SynthSR，将低场强(0.064t)T1和T2加权大脑MRI序列转换成空间分辨率为1毫米的各向同性图像，并出现T1加权磁化准备快速梯度回波（MP-RAGE）采集。 在描述他们在放射学中的概念验证研究时，研究人员报告说，合成图像与1.5T和3.0T MRI扫描仪获得的图像显示出高度相关性。马萨诸塞州总医院和哈佛医学院的首席研究员胡安·尤金尼奥·伊格莱西亚斯。形态计量学，对图像中结构的定量大小和形状分析，是许多神经影像学研究的核心。 不幸的是，大多数MRI分析工具是为近各向同性、高分辨率采集而设计的，通常需要T1加权图像，如MP-RAGE。 它们的性能往往随着体素尺寸和各向异性的增加而迅速下降。 由于现有的绝大多数临床MRI扫描都是高度各向异性的，无法用现有工具进行可靠的分析。首席研究员胡安·尤金尼奥·伊格莱西亚斯（Juan Eugenio Iglesias）解释说：“每年都会产生数百万张低分辨率的大脑磁共振图像，但目前无法用神经成像软件进行分析。” “我目前研究的主要目标是开发算法，使低分辨率大脑MR图像看起来像我们在研究中使用的高分辨率MRI扫描。 我对两个应用特别感兴趣：实现临床扫描的自动三维分析和便携式低场MRI扫描仪的使用。“培训和测试LF-SYNTHSR是建立在SYNTHSR基础上的，该团队开发了一种方法，用于训练CNN从常规临床MR扫描中预测1毫米分辨率的MP-RAGE各向同性扫描。 此前在NeuroImage上报道的发现表明，SYNTHSR生成的图像可以可靠地用于皮层下分割和体积测量、图像配准，如果满足某些质量要求，甚至可以用于皮层厚度形态测量。LF-SYNTHSR和SYNTHSR都是在从3D分割中生成的外观高度变化的合成输入图像上训练的，因此可以用来训练CNNs的对比度、分辨率和方位的任何组合。Iglesias指出，当数据看起来近似恒定时，神经网络表现最好，但每家医院都使用不同供应商的扫描仪，这些扫描仪配置不同，导致扫描高度异构。 他解释说：“为了解决这个问题，我们借鉴了一个叫做‘领域随机化’的机器学习领域的思想，在这个领域，你用模拟的合成图像来训练神经网络，以不断改变外观和分辨率，从而获得对输入图像的外观不可知的训练网络。”为了评估LF-SynthSR的性能，研究人员将合成磁共振成像和地面真实高场强图像之间的大脑形态测量进行了关联。 为了训练，他们使用了来自20名受试者的1毫米各向同性MP-RAGE扫描的高场强MRI数据集。 他们还使用了36个脑感兴趣区和3个脑外感兴趣区的相应分段。 训练集还被人为地增强以更好地模拟病理组织，如中风或出血。测试集包括来自24名有神经症状的参与者的成像数据，他们除了接受标准护理高场强(1.5-3T)MRI之外，还接受了低场强(0.064T)扫描。 该算法成功地从低场强脑磁共振成像中生成了1-mm各向同性合成MP-RAGE图像，体素比原始数据小10倍以上。 对来自11名参与者的最终样本的合成图像进行自动分割，得到的ROI体积与高场强磁共振扫描的ROI体积高度相关。研究人员写道：“LF-SynthSR可能会改善低场强磁共振扫描的图像质量，以至于它们不仅可以通过自动分割方法使用，还可能通过配准和分类算法使用。” “它还可以用来增加异常病变的检测。”这种使用自动形态计量分析低分辨率脑部磁共振成像的能力将有助于研究罕见疾病和在当前神经成像研究中代表性不足的人群。 此外，提高便携式MRI扫描仪的图像质量将提高其在以下领域的应用 ", "content_en": "AI creates high-resolution brain images from low-field strength MR scansPortable, low-field-strength MRI systems have the potential to transform neuroimaging – provided that their low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio can be overcome. Researchers at Harvard Medical School are harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve this goal. They have developed a machine learning super-resolution algorithm that generates synthetic images with high spatial resolution from lower resolution brain MRI scans.The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, known as LF-SynthSR, converts low-field-strength (0.064 T) T1- and T2-weighted brain MRI sequences into isotropic images with 1 mm spatial resolution and the appearance of a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) acquisition. Describing their proof-of-concept study in Radiology, the researchers report that the synthetic images exhibited high correlation with images acquired by 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI scanners.Principal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.Morphometry, the quantitative size and shape analysis of structures in an image, is central to many neuroimaging studies. Unfortunately, most MRI analysis tools are designed for near-isotropic, high-resolution acquisitions and typically require T1-weighted images such as MP-RAGE. Their performance often drops rapidly as voxel size and anisotropy increase. As the vast majority of existing clinical MRI scans are highly anisotropic, they cannot be reliably analysed with existing tools.“Millions of low-resolution brain MR images are produced every year, but currently cannot be analysed with neuroimaging software,” explains principal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias. “The main goal of my current research is to develop algorithms that make low-resolution brain MR images look like the high-resolution MRI scans that we use in research. I am particularly interested in two applications: enabling automated 3D analysis of the clinical scans and use with portable, low-field MRI scanners.”Training and testingLF-SynthSR is built upon SynthSR, a method developed by the team to train a CNN to predict 1 mm-resolution MP-RAGE isotropic scans from routine clinical MR scans. Previous findings reported in NeuroImage showed that SynthSR-generated images could be reliably used for subcortical segmentation and volumetry, image registration and, if some quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.Both LF-SynthSR and SynthSR are trained on synthetic input images of highly varying appearance generated from 3D segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of contrast, resolution and orientation.Iglesias points out that neural networks perform best when data appear approximately constant, but every hospital uses scanners from different vendors that are configured differently, resulting in highly heterogeneous scans. “To tackle this problem, we are borrowing ideas from a field of machine learning called ‘domain randomization’, where you train neural networks with synthetic images that are simulated to constantly change appearance and resolution, in order to obtain trained networks that are agnostic to the appearance of the input images,” he explains.To assess the performance of LF-SynthSR, the researchers correlated brain morphology measurements between synthetic MRIs and ground-truth high-field strength images. For training, they used a high-field-strength MRI dataset of 1-mm isotropic MP-RAGE scans from 20 subjects. They also used corresponding segmentations of 36 brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) and three extracerebral ROIs. The training set was also artificially augmented to better model pathologic tissue such as stroke or haemorrhage.The test set comprised imaging data from 24 participants with neurological symptoms who had a low-field strength (0.064 T) scan in addition to a standard-of-care high-field strength (1.5–3 T) MRI. The algorithm successfully generated 1-mm isotropic synthetic MP-RAGE images from the low-field strength brain MRIs, with voxels more than 10 times smaller than in the original data. Automated segmentation of the synthetic images from a final sample of 11 participants yielded ROI volumes that were highly correlated with those derived from the high-field strength MR scans.“LF-SynthSR may improve the image quality of low-field strength MRI scans to the point that they are usable not only by automated segmentation methods but potentially also with registration and classification algorithms,” the researchers write. “It could also be used to augment the detection of abnormal lesions.”This ability to analyse low-resolution brain MRIs using automated morphometry would enable the study of rare diseases and populations that are under-represented in current neuroimaging research. In addition, improving the quality of images from portable MRI scanners would enhance their use in medically underserved areas, as well as in critical care, where moving patients to an MRI suite is often too risky.Iglesias says that another challenge is the wide range of abnormalities found in clinical scans that need to be handled by the CNN. “Currently, SynthSR works well with healthy brains, cases with atrophy, and smaller abnormalities like small multiple sclerosis lesions or small strokes,” he tells Physics World. “We are currently working to improve the method so it can effectively deal with larger lesions, like larger strokes or tumours.”Writing in an accompanying editorial in Radiology, Birgit Ertl-Wagner and Matthias Wagner from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto comment: “This exciting technical development study demonstrates the potential to go low on field strength and aim high for spatial and contrast resolution using artificial intelligence.”", "abstract": "近日，美国哈佛医学院利用人工智能技术实现了克服核磁共振成像(MRI)系统低空间分辨率和低信噪比(SNR)的目标。研究人员开发出一种机器学习超分辨率算法，可利用较低分辨率大脑核磁共振成像扫描图像生成具有高空间分辨率的合成图像。该算法被称为卷积神经网络(CNN)算法，也称为LF-SynthSR算法，能将低场强(0.064 T) T1和T2加权像的大脑核磁共振成像序列转换为各向同性图像。该算法建立在SynthSR算法基础上，而SynthSR算法可用于训练卷积神经网络(CNN)利用常规临床磁共振成扫描图像预测高达1毫米分辨率的优化磁化制备快速梯度回波(MP-RAGE)各向同性扫描图像。为评估LF-SynthSR算法的性能，研究人员将合成核磁共振成像和地面真实高场强图像间的大脑形态学测量结果进行了关联。实验结果显示，该算法在体素比原始数据小10倍以上的情况下成功利用低场强脑核磁共振成像生成了1毫米分辨率各向同性合成优化磁化制备快速梯度回波图像。该研究提高了医疗检测的效率，使利用神经影像学发现代表性不足的罕见疾病和人群成为可能。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/ai-creates-high-resolution-brain-images-from-low-field-strength-mr-scans/"}, {"title": "美国开发出直接印制柔性集成电路的新技术", "keyword": "电路 弹性聚合物 纳米线 智能隐形眼镜", "content_zh": "从隐形眼镜到乳胶手套，在曲面上打印柔性电路的技术来自北卡罗来纳州立大学的研究人员展示了一种新技术，可以直接将电子电路打印到曲面和波纹面上。 这项工作为各种新的软电子技术铺平了道路，研究人员利用这项技术创造了原型“智能”隐形眼镜、压敏乳胶手套和透明电极。“使用各种材料创造印刷电子产品的现有技术有很多，但存在局限性，”该工作论文的相应作者Yong Zhu说。 “一个挑战是，现有技术要求在打印电路的‘墨水’中使用聚合物结合剂。 这损害了电路的导电性，所以你必须在打印后加入额外的步骤来移除这些粘合剂。“第二个挑战是，这些打印技术通常要求你在平坦的表面上打印，但许多应用程序需要不平坦的表面，”朱说，他是NC State的安德鲁·亚当斯机械和航空航天工程杰出教授。“我们开发了一种不需要粘合剂的技术，允许我们在各种曲线表面上打印，”该论文的第一作者、博士刘宇轩说 北卡罗来纳州立大学的学生。 “它还允许我们将电路打印成厚度均匀的栅格结构。”新技术的第一步是为相关应用创建一个模板，其中包含特定的微尺度凹槽模式。 然后模板被用来在薄的弹性聚合物薄膜中复制该图案。 研究人员随后将薄膜聚合物贴到相关的基底上，基底可以是平的，也可以是弯曲的。 此时，聚合物中的微小凹槽充满了含有银纳米线的液体溶液。该溶液在室温下干燥，在柔软的材料中留下具有所需形状和电路图案的银纳米线。为了演示这项技术，研究人员创建了三个概念验证原型。 一种是内置电路的“智能”隐形眼镜，可以用来测量眼睛的流体压力--这与一些生物医学应用有关。 一种是柔性透明电极，电路印刷成网格状，可以用于太阳能电池或触摸面板。第三种是一种乳胶手套，上面印有用作压力传感器的电路，应用于机器人和人机界面应用。“我们认为，就制造而言，这可以很容易地扩大规模，”朱说。 “我们愿意与对探索这项技术潜力感兴趣的行业交谈。”该论文发表在《科学进展》上。 ", "content_en": "Technique prints flexible circuits on curved surfaces, from contact lenses to latex glovesResearchers from North Carolina State University have demonstrated a new technique for directly printing electronic circuits onto curved and corrugated surfaces.

The findings of this study facilitate improved and more efficient static prevention with commercialization potential by expanding the application range of triboelectric nanogenerators.Recent developments in semiconductors and small electronic components have increased the interest in static prevention, as static damage to small components leads to an increased defect rate. Currently, companies use a combination of various anti-static products such as wired grounding wristbands, antistatic mats, shoes, and ionizers. However, these methods result in increased equipment costs and operational inconveniences. Therefore, an efficient and simple static-prevention method is required.The research team focused on the cause of static conditions. The human body is generally static owing to the electric potential difference between the body and an object when both come in contact.The cause of this electric potential difference has been found in recent studies on triboelectric series between materials. Because the human skin is on the positive side of the triboelectric series, it becomes positively charged when it contacts typically used objects such as shoes and clothes, sharply increasing the body electric potential to positive, causing static. The measurement results of the research team showed that the electric potential of the body increased by more than 100 V after walking for approximately 10 s.As a solution, a method for transmitting negative charges to the body was developed. Using a triboelectric nanogenerator, the physical energy generated through body movements, such as walking, can be converted into electrical energy. A rectifier provides a negative charge to the body. The team observed that the electric potential of the body decreased to a negative value.The team also confirmed that the rate of decrease in the body electric potential varies based on the output (voltage, current, and charge) of the triboelectric nanogenerator, and the type and surface area of the discharger.

In their paper published in the journal Nature Materials, the group describes how they built their new sensor and possible uses for it.Sensors that react to light have become very common in the modern world—lights that turn on when the presence of an intruder is detected, for example. Such sensors are typically made of a grid of pixels, each of which are reactive to light. Performance of such sensors are based on measurements of responsivity, and which parts of light they detect.Most are designed with certain noise-to-signal constraints. In this new effort, the researchers noted that most such sensors are also very inefficient, using far more electricity than should be the case for such devices.To make a sensor that would be more efficient, the researchers looked at the materials that are used to make those now in use—generally a silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor serves as the backbone. And it was the backbone where the researchers focused their effort. To make a sensor that would be more efficient, they replaced the traditional backbone with one made from molybdenum disulfide, a material that, like graphene, can be grown as a one atom thick sheet.In their work, they grew it on a sapphire base via vapor deposition. Then then lifted the finished product from the base and laid it on a base of silicon dioxide that had already been wire etched. They then finished their product by etching additional wiring on the top.The result of their work was a 30x30 grid, where each of the pixels was its own device—one that was not only capable of detecting light but could also be drained using an electrode that made it ready for use again after something has been sensed.In assessing the characteristics of their sensor, they found it to be far more efficient than those now in use, each pixel used less than a picojoule. They also found it very easy to reset. One shot of voltage across the array did the trick. On the other hand, the researchers found that it responded far slower to light than sensors currently in use. This, they note, suggests it could be used as an all-purpose light sensor, but not as fixture in a camera. They further suggest it could provide an ideal sensing solution in a wide variety of IoT applications.", "abstract": "近日，美国宾夕法尼亚州立大学的研究人员使用原子级超薄材料开发了一种900像素的成像传感器。为了制造出更高效的传感器，研究人员用二硫化钼制成的骨架取代了传统的骨架，二硫化钼是一种像石墨烯一样的材料，可以生长成单原子厚的薄片。在他们的工作中，他们通过气相沉积将其生长在蓝宝石基底上。然后把成品从底座上取下来，放在已经用金属线蚀刻过的二氧化硅底座上。接下来他们在顶部蚀刻额外的线路。他们的成品是一个30x30的网格，这个设备不仅能够探测光线，还可以使用电极将其耗尽，以便在感知到某些东西后再次使用。他们发现它比目前使用的传感器效率高很多，每个像素的利用率不到1皮焦耳。此外，他们还发现该设备很容易被重置，只需在阵列上施加一次电压就可以成功实现重置。这一研究成果将有望在物联网应用中提供理想的传感解决方案。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-pixel-imaging-sensor-atomically-thin.html"}, {"title": "德国研发出可追踪纳米尺度波动的相干相关成像技术", "keyword": "纳米级材料波动 相干相关成像 成像技术", "content_zh": "相干相关成像跟踪纳米尺度上的涨落利用一种新的图像重建技术，德国和美国的物理学家制作了磁性材料纳米尺度涨落的清晰而详细的电影。 为了捕捉这些特征，柏林马克斯·伯恩研究所的克里斯托弗·克洛泽领导的一个小组使用了一种先进的算法来识别多张X射线图像中空间模式的相关性。涨落和相变是物质的一种近乎普遍的特征，X射线和电子成像技术可以用于在纳米尺度上观察这些现象。 然而，这些方法在高空间分辨率和高时间分辨率之间有一个内在的平衡--后者需要跟踪涨落和相变的动力学。虽然时间和空间分辨率都可以通过增强照明来提高，但强X射线和电子束会破坏样本中的微妙特征。为了克服这一限制，Klose的团队开发了一种称为相干相关成像(CCI)的技术。 他们的方法依赖于这样一个事实，即纳米尺度的波动不是完全随机的，而是显示出独特的空间模式。许多SnapshotSCCI首先涉及使用相对较低的光照水平快速连续拍摄数千张样本快照。 虽然这些快照看起来彼此很模糊，但研究人员发现它们包含了足够的信息，可以使用层次聚类算法对每幅图像进行分类。 这将图像分类为具有显示明确相关性的空间模式的组。 通过组合每组的图像，研究小组能够重建样本中模式的清晰图像。为了证明他们的方法，克洛泽和同事使用CCI和X射线对薄膜铁磁体中的波动进行成像。 这种材料广泛应用于现代硬盘驱动器中，信息被编码到磁域中。 这些是纳米级的区域，其中磁化可以指向两个相反的方向之一。 已知这些畴在室温下高度稳定，几乎没有因涨落而丢失的信息。 然而，到目前为止，研究人员还不能通过对材料进行成像来直接证实这种稳定性。克洛泽的团队使用CCI测试了铁磁体在37°C（高于室温）下的稳定性。 该算法远没有保持静态，而是识别了胶片中30个不同的畴态之间的转换。 通过评估这些状态之间的相似性，研究人员还确定了跃迁发生的顺序。 这使得克洛泽和他的同事们能够构建出清晰、详细的脉动电影。通过进一步的改进，CCI很快就能让研究人员回答包括高温超导体在内的先进材料相变本质的基本问题。 克洛泽和他的同事们现在希望将他们的技术扩展到电子显微镜--允许他们在更小的尺度上重建图像。这项技术在《自然》杂志上有描述。 ", "content_en": "Coherent correlation imaging tracks fluctuations on the nanoscaleUsing a new image reconstruction technique, physicists in Germany and the US have made clear and detailed movies of nanoscale fluctuations in a magnetic material. To capture these features, a team led by Christopher Klose at the Max Born Institute, Berlin, used an advanced algorithm to identify correlations in the spatial patterns in multiple X-ray images.Fluctuations and phase transitions are a near-universal features of matter and X-ray and electron imaging techniques can be used to observe these phenomena on the nanoscale. However, these methods have an inherent trade-off between high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution – the latter being needed to track the dynamics of fluctuations and phase transitions.While both temporal and spatial resolution can be improved by boosting illumination, intense beams of X-rays and electrons can damage delicate features in a sample.To overcome this limitation, Klose’s team has developed a technique called coherent correlation imaging (CCI). Their approach relies on the fact that nanoscale fluctuations are not entirely random, but instead display distinctive spatial patterns.Many snapshotsCCI first involves taking thousands of snapshots of samples in quick succession, using relatively low levels of illumination. While these snapshots appear to be mostly indistinct from each other, the researchers found they contain enough information to categorise each image using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. This sorts the images into groups with spatial patterns that display clear correlations. By combining the images in each group, the team was able to reconstruct clear images of the patterns in samples.To demonstrate their approach, Klose and colleagues used CCI and X-rays to image fluctuations in a thin-film ferromagnet. This material is widely used in modern hard drives, where information is encoded into magnetic domains. These are nanoscale regions in which the magnetization can either point in one of two opposing directions. These domains are known to be highly stable at room temperature, with little information lost due to fluctuations. So far, however, researchers have not been able to confirm this stability directly by imaging the material.Klose’s team used CCI to test the ferromagnet’s stability at 37 °C, which is above room temperature. Far from remaining static, the algorithm identified transitions between 30 distinct domain states in the film. By assessing the similarity between these states, the researchers also determined the order in which the transitions occurred. This allowed Klose and colleagues to construct clear, detailed movies of the fluctuations.Through further improvements, CCI could soon enable researchers to answer fundamental questions surrounding the nature of phase transitions in advanced materials including high-temperature superconductors. Klose and colleagues now hope to extend their technique to electron microscopy – allowing them to reconstruct images on even smaller scales.The technique is described in Nature.", "abstract": "近日，由德国马克斯·波恩研究所领导的研究团队开发出一种革命性的新方法，可利用强大的X射线源捕获纳米级材料波动的高分辨率图像。相干相关成像原理用于对随机过程进行成像，例如抛硬币。硬币的单个简短图像可能无法充分曝光以清楚地识别硬币上的图像。然而，一种新的算法可以对多张图像进行排序和组合，以生成硬币两面的清晰图像，然后将其准确地分配给曝光时刻。该研究团队开发出的新的无损成像方法，称为相干相关成像。具体地，为了制作一段影像，他们快速连续地拍摄样本的多个快照，同时降低足够的光照以保持样本的完好无损。尽管这会导致个别图像中样品的波动模式变得不清晰，但这些图像仍包含足够的信息以将它们分成几组。研究团队首先创建一种新的算法来分析图像之间的相关性。每个组中的快照非常相似，因此可能来自相同的特定波动模式。只有当一组中的所有镜头一起观看时，才会出现样本的清晰图像。科学家们现在能将每一张快照与样本当时状态的清晰图像联系起来。该团队在由薄磁性层制成的样品上展示了相干相关成像。他们创建了一张地图，显示了被称为磁畴的区域之间边界的首选位置。这张地图和运动的影像使人们更好地理解了材料中的磁性相互作用，促进了未来在先进计算机体系结构中的应用。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/coherent-correlation-imaging-tracks-fluctuations-on-the-nanoscale/"}, {"title": "美国开发出用于相控阵雷达的三级电源解决方案", "keyword": "相控阵雷达 三级电源解决方案 氮化镓 功率放大器 评估板", "content_zh": "Qorvo为相控阵雷达推出三级电源解决方案美国北卡罗来纳州格林斯博罗市的Qorvo公司（为移动、基础设施和国防应用提供核心技术和射频解决方案）宣布了一款用于相控阵商用和国防雷达的紧凑的三级电源解决方案。 三芯片解决方案提供了可配置的氮化镓（GaN）偏置点自动校准，使工程师能够在不改变电路板设计的情况下最大化不同GaN功率放大器（PAs）的系统性能。新芯片组优化了相控阵系统中最大和最昂贵的部分之一：脉冲储能电容器。 通过新的架构，该解决方案将电容降低了90%，将系统体积缩小了30%，同时降低了重量和运营成本。Qorvo高性能模拟业务总裁菲利普·切斯利（Philip Chesley）表示：“这一完整的雷达电源解决方案集成了Qorvo的先进技术，结合了创新的新功率转换架构、我们同类最佳的GaN RF功率放大器和高效、可靠的碳化硅FET。”新的三阶段解决方案包括以下内容:ACT43950是一款高压恒流电容充电控制器，与Qorvo的碳化硅功率开关一起工作，提供完全可编程的输出电压和电流， 允许客户最大化系统性能。 此稳压器的结构与以下几个级相结合，最大限度地降低了对功率存储电容的要求。ACT43850是一种RF负载点(RFPOL)降压DC-DC功率转换器，它从ACT43950获得输出，并将其降压到针对Qorvo GaN功率放大器优化的良好调节电压。 ACT43750是一款高度集成的漏极开关和负栅极电压调节器电源管理集成电路(PMIC)，能够实现超快的RF GaN PA漏极开关。 通过自动化栅极电压偏置排序、自动校准和动态偏置重新校准，Qorvo简化了系统制造，同时减轻了器件老化和温度对RF性能的影响。Qorvo提供了一个评估板(CB1-750-850-950)，允许客户使用广泛的RF GaN PAS测试这种三阶段解决方案的性能。 评估板的直观图形用户界面(GUI)允许客户重新配置默认设置，以优化其特定PA的性能。 它展示了减少的体积电容要求和栅偏置自动校准。 该板的灵活设计可用于评估单个级或整个三芯片解决方案的射频PA，使上市时间更快。 ", "content_en": "Qorvo introduces three-stage power solution for phased-array radarQorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense applications) has announced a compact, three-stage power solution for phased-array commercial and defense radar.

Imagine how much more nerve-wracking that game would be if, instead of plush stuffed animals, you were trying to grab a fragile piece of endangered coral or a priceless artifact from a sunken ship.Most of today's robotic grippers rely on embedded sensors, complex feedback loops, or advanced machine learning algorithms, combined with the skill of the operator, to grasp fragile or irregularly shaped objects. But researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have demonstrated an easier way.Taking inspiration from nature, they designed a new type of soft, robotic gripper that uses a collection of thin tentacles to entangle and ensnare objects, similar to how jellyfish collect stunned prey. Alone, individual tentacles, or filaments, are weak. But together, the collection of filaments can grasp and securely hold heavy and oddly shaped objects. The gripper relies on simple inflation to wrap around objects and doesn't require sensing, planning, or feedback control.The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\"With this research, we wanted to reimagine how we interact with objects,\" said Kaitlyn Becker, former graduate student and postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and first author of the paper. \"By taking advantage of the natural compliance of soft robotics and enhancing it with a compliant structure, we designed a gripper that is greater than the sum of its parts and a grasping strategy that can adapt to a range of complex objects with minimal planning and perception.\"Becker is currently an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.The gripper's strength and adaptability come from its ability to entangle itself with the object it is attempting to grasp. The foot-long filaments are hollow, rubber tubes. One side of the tube has thicker rubber than the other, so when the tube is pressurized, it curls like a pigtail or like straightened hair on a rainy day.The curls knot and entangle with each other and the object, with each entanglement increasing the strength of the hold. While the collective hold is strong, each contact is individually weak and won't damage even the most fragile object. To release the object, the filaments are simply depressurized.The researchers used simulations and experimenThe researchers used simulations and experiments to test the efficacy of the gripper, picking up a range of objects, including various houseplants and toys. The gripper could be used in real-world applications to grasp soft fruits and vegetables for agricultural production and distribution, delicate tissue in medical settings, even irregularly shaped objects in warehouses, such as glassware.This new approach to grasping combines Professor L. Mahadevan's research on the topological mechanics of entangled filaments with Professor Robert Wood's research on soft robotic grippers.\"Entanglement enables each highly compliant filament to conform locally with a target object leading to a secure but gentle topological grasp that is relatively independent of the details of the nature of the contact,\" said Mahadevan, the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics in SEAS, and of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and Physics in FAS and co-corresponding author of the paper.\"This new approach to robotic grasping complements existing solutions by replacing simple, traditional grippers that require complex control strategies with extremely compliant, and morphologically complex filaments that can operate with very simple control,\" said Wood, the Harry Lewis and Marlyn McGrath Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences and co-corresponding author of the paper. \"This approach expands the range of what's possible to pick up with robotic grippers.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国哈佛大学工程与应用科学学院研究人员从大自然中汲取灵感，设计了一种新型柔软的机器人抓手。它使用一组细长的触手来缠绕和诱捕物体，类似于水母捕获猎物的方式。当今的大多数机器人抓手依靠嵌入式传感器、复杂的反馈回路或先进的机器学习算法，结合操作员的技能，来抓取易碎或形状不规则的物体。该研究团队利用柔性机器人的自然顺应性并通过顺应结构对其进行增强，设计了一种独特的抓手，以及一种能够以最少的规划和感知适应一系列复杂物体的抓取策略。抓手依靠简单的充气来包裹物体，不需要传感、规划或反馈控制。单独的触手或细丝很弱，但细丝集合在一起可抓住并牢固地固定沉重和形状奇特的物体。研究人员通过实验来测试抓手的功效，包括抓起多种植物和玩具。在实际应用中，抓手可抓取农业生产和配送中新鲜软水果和蔬菜、医疗环境中的脆弱人体组织，甚至可抓取玻璃器皿等不规则形状物体。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-tentacle-robot-gently-grasp-fragile.html"}, {"title": "奥地利开发出可提高工业生产效率的新型X射线激光脉冲技术", "keyword": "X射线激光脉冲 工业生产 镱激光器 钛蓝宝石激光器", "content_zh": "一种新的更好的X射线激光脉冲技术用于医院检查断腿的X射线很容易产生。 然而，在工业中，需要一种完全不同的X射线辐射--即尽可能短和高能量的X射线激光脉冲。 例如，它们被用于纳米结构和电子元件的生产，但也被用于实时监测化学反应。纳米波长范围内的强烈、极短波X射线脉冲很难产生，但现在在Tu Wien（维也纳）开发了一种新的、更简单的方法：起点不是钛蓝宝石激光器，它主要用于这一目的，而是镱激光器。 关键的技巧是，光然后通过气体来改变其性质。波长长导致波长短。激光束的波长取决于产生激光束的材料：在涉及的原子或分子中，电子从一种状态转变为另一种能量较低的状态。 这导致光子被发射--它的波长（因此它的颜色）取决于电子在其状态变化过程中损失了多少能量。 通过这种方法，可以产生不同的激光颜色--从红色到紫色。然而，为了产生波长更小的激光束，必须使用特殊的技巧：首先，产生长波长的激光束并射向原子。 一个电子被从原子中剥离出来，并在激光的电场中加速。 然后，它又折回并再次与产生它的原子碰撞--因此，它可以产生短波X射线。 这种技术被称为“高次谐波产生”。“乍一看，这种情况似乎有点违背直觉，”图温光子学研究所的保罗·卡佩贾尼说。 “事实证明，事实上，原始激光束的波长越大，最终你能实现的波长就越小。” 然而，在这个过程中产生X射线辐射的效率也会降低：如果要产生很短波的辐射，它的强度就会变得很低。迄今为止，这种技术几乎都是通过使用钛蓝宝石激光器，然后用特殊的晶体增加其辐射波长，通过高次谐波产生尽可能短的X射线辐射。 然而，Tu Wien的团队现在开发了一种更简单，同时也更强大的方法：他们使用镱激光器。 镱激光器比钛蓝宝石激光器更简单、更便宜、更强大，但到目前为止，它们在X射线产生方面的性能要低得多。在图温，镱激光器的辐射波长首先得到提高--不是像往常一样通过晶体发出辐射，而是通过分子气体发出辐射。 “这极大地提高了效率，”保罗·卡尔佩吉亚尼说。 该论文发表在ACS光子学杂志上，“我们过去得到的是20%，现在得到的是80%左右。” ", "content_en": "A new, better technology for X-ray laser pulsesThe X-rays used to examine a broken leg in hospital are easy to produce. In industry, however, X-ray radiation of a completely different kind is needed—namely, X-ray laser pulses that are as short and high-energy as possible. They are used, for example, in the production of nanostructures and electronic components, but also to monitor chemical reactions in real time.Intense, extremely short-wave X-ray pulses in the nanometer wavelength range are difficult to produce, but now a new, simpler method has been developed at TU Wien (Vienna): the starting point is not a titanium-sapphire laser, which had mostly been used for this purpose, but an ytterbium laser. The crucial trick is that the light is then sent through a gas in order to change its properties.Long wavelengths lead to short wavelengthsThe wavelength of a laser beam depends on the material in which it is generated: In the atoms or molecules involved, electrons change from one state to another state with lower energy. This causes a photon to be emitted—its wavelength (and thus its color) depends on how much energy the electron lost during its change of state. In this way, different laser colors can be produced—from red to violet.However, for creating laser beams with even much smaller wavelengths, special tricks have to be employed: First, laser beams with a long wavelength are created and shot at atoms. An electron is ripped away from the atom and accelerated in the electric field of the laser. It then turns back and collides again with the atom from which it came—and thereby it can produce short-wave X-rays. This technique is called \"high harmonic generation.\"\"At first glance, the situation seems somewhat counter-intuitive,\" says Paolo Carpeggiani from the Institute of Photonics at TU Wien. \"It turns out, in fact, that the larger the wavelength of the original laser beam, the smaller the wavelengths you can achieve in the end.\" However, the efficiency of X-ray radiation production also decreases in the process: if you want to produce very short-wave radiation, its intensity becomes very low.Ytterbium instead of titanium sapphire, gas instead of crystalUntil now, this technique was almost always employed by using titanium-sapphire lasers and then increasing the wavelength of their radiation with special crystals in order to generate the shortest possible X-ray radiation through High Harmonic Generation. However, the team at TU Wien has now developed a simpler and at the same time more powerful method: they used an ytterbium laser. Ytterbium lasers are simpler, cheaper and more powerful than titanium-sapphire lasers, but until now, their performance in X-ray production was much lower.At TU Wien, the wavelength of the ytterbium laser's radiation was first increased—not by sending this radiation through a crystal as usual, but by sending it through a molecular gas. \"This increases the efficiency quite dramatically,\" says Paolo Carpeggiani. \"Instead of the 20% we used to get, we get around 80%.\"The paper is published in the journal ACS Photonics.", "abstract": "近日，维也纳科技大学使用镱激光器代替钛蓝宝石开发出一种新型X射线激光脉冲技术，该技术可以通过让光穿过气体来改变气体性质。目前，在医疗上容易使用X射线技术来诊断病情，但在工业中使用X射线技术进行生产难度极大，特别在属于纳米量级的强超短波X射线脉冲波长范围内。为此，研究团队使用镱激光器代替钛蓝宝石激光器参与生产，相比之下，镱激光器更简单、更便宜且更强大。虽然该技术在X射线生产方面的性能相对较低，但并不影响其所创造的价值。研究人员通过增加镱激光辐射的波长，让其通过分子气体发送辐射，从而将效率从20%提高到了80％。该研究不仅为工业生产提供了新的生产方法，还提高了生产效率，促进了光学技术的创新。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-technology-x-ray-laser-pulses.html"}, {"title": "美国堪萨斯州承诺向芯片厂投资3", "keyword": "芯片厂 智能手机 救生医疗设备 ", "content_zh": "堪萨斯州承诺向芯片厂提供3.04亿美元，以吸引联邦资金。堪萨斯州计划向其最大城市的一家半导体公司提供3.04亿美元的纳税人资助激励措施，以建设一个巨大的新工厂，但如果没有美国政府承诺的重建国家芯片制造能力的资金，该项目将无法推进。gov 劳拉·凯利（Laura Kelly）周四宣布，堪萨斯州与总部位于威奇托的Integra Technologies达成了一项为期10年的税收减免和费用报销一揽子协议。 州官员表示，这座耗资18亿美元的新工厂将占地100万平方英尺，有2000名员工，并在供应商和其他当地企业中创造3000个额外的就业机会。这一声明发布之际，美国正试图扭转制造芯片的能力损失，这些芯片对智能手机、笔记本电脑和其他现代便利设施以及汽车和救生医疗设备至关重要。 国会去年批准了一项措施，为半导体行业提供超过520亿美元的赠款和其他激励措施。凯利在州议会的新闻发布会上告诉记者，该州的激励措施对于吸引联邦资金和“使堪萨斯州成为我们国家国家安全努力的重要组成部分”至关重要。凯利说：“这个先进的制造设施是国家努力恢复我们半导体行业的一部分，以便美国工人和企业能够在21世纪的竞争中竞争和获胜。”Integra首席执行官布雷特·罗宾逊不愿透露该公司需要多少联邦资金， 只有在没有它的情况下，“没有商业上可行的方法”来做这个项目。 他和州官员表示，其他州也在试图吸引该项目，但他们没有透露竞争对手。“这不仅对美国和安全至关重要，对供应链也至关重要，”堪萨斯州参议院议长泰·马斯特森（Ty Masterson）说，他是威奇托地区的共和党人。乔·拜登总统去年推动国会提振美国半导体行业，因为全球新冠肺炎疫情加剧了芯片短缺，并担心与国际竞争对手，特别是中国竞争。 几十年来，亚洲芯片厂已经转向运营成本更低的亚洲芯片厂，该行业现在依赖台湾，中国长期以来一直声称台湾是自己的。罗宾逊说：“如果我们在可持续的时间内失去东南亚供应链的机会，我们刚刚经历的事情相比之下就相形见绌了。”成立于1983年的Integra在威奇托和硅谷拥有约500名员工，并自称为芯片制造过程中最后两个主要组装和测试步骤的美国最大供应商。 新工厂预计将支付平均年薪5.1万美元，比该州平均年薪约3.5万美元高出约46%。为了获得激励，Integra必须在未来五年内向新工厂投资至少15亿美元，并连续10年提供相当于1600个全职工作岗位。这些激励措施是堪萨斯州去年创建的一项计划的一部分，该计划旨在加大与其他州竞争新的大型工厂的力度。 根据该计划，该州被允许在2022年和2023年各向一家公司提供高达10亿美元的激励措施。2022年7月，凯利和其他州官员宣布，松下公司计划建造一家大型工厂，为特斯拉和其他汽车制造商生产电动汽车电池。 该州在10年内以价值8.29亿美元的激励措施将这家日本电子巨头的项目吸引到堪萨斯城地区的边缘，这是该州有史以来提供的最多激励措施。允许激励措施的法律要求共和党控制的立法机构的最高领导人签署公司与州商务部之间的任何协议，该协议由副州长大卫·托兰（David Toland）领导，他是像凯利一样的民主党人。 立法领导人在宣布前几分钟批准了这一协议，此前他们与凯利私下会面了半个小时，审查了该协议，没有公开审查或参与的机会。该法律还要求堪萨斯州将每笔大型交易的企业所得税税率降低0.5个百分点。 如果Integra项目继续下去，最高税率将从7%下降到6%，每年为所有公司节省约1亿美元。虽然两个大型项目都得到了两党的支持，但一些立法者对向一家公司承诺如此大的纳税人资助激励措施持批评态度。“我们还没有为第一个项目开支票，他们甚至不知道它有效就开始了第二个项目，”堪萨斯州东部的保守派共和党人、州参议院税务委员会主席卡琳·泰森在周四宣布之前说。 ", "content_en": "Kansas commits $304M to chip plant to lure federal fundsKansas plans to give $304 million in taxpayer-funded incentives to a semiconductor company in its largest city to build a huge new factory, but the project won't go forward without funds the U.S. government has promised for rebuilding the nation's chip-making capacity.Gov. Laura Kelly announced Thursday that Kansas has an agreement with Integra Technologies, based in Wichita, for a 10-year package of tax breaks and reimbursement of expenses. State officials said the new, $1.8 billion plant would cover 1 million square feet, have 2,000 employees and create 3,000 additional jobs among suppliers and other local businesses.The announcement comes with the U.S. trying to reverse a loss of capacity for making the chips that are vital to smartphones, laptops and other modern-day conveniences, as well as automobiles and life-saving medical devices. Congress last year approved a measure that provides more than $52 billion in grants and other incentives for the semiconductor industry.Kelly told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that the state's incentives are crucial to attracting the federal funds and \"making Kansas an essential part of our country's national security efforts.\"\"This advanced manufacturing facility is part of a national push to restore our semiconductor industry so that U.S. workers and businesses can compete and win in the race for the 21st Century,\" Kelly said.Integra CEO Brett Robinson would not say how much federal funding the company needs, only that there is \"no commercially viable way\" to do the project without it. He and state officials said other states were trying to attract the project, though they did not disclose the competitors.\"It's not just critical to the United States and to security, but it's critical to the supply chain,\" said Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican.President Joe Biden pushed Congress last year to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, because of a shortage of chips made worse by the global coronavirus pandemic and concerns about competing with international rivals, particularly China. There's been a decades-long shift to cheaper-to-operate Asian chip plants, and the industry is now dependent on Taiwan, which China has long claimed as its own.\"If we were ever to lose, for a sustainable amount of time, access to the southeast Asian supply chain, what we just went through would pale in comparison,\" Robinson said.Integra, founded in 1983, has about 500 employees in Wichita and Silicon Valley and describes itself as the largest U.S. provider of the last two major assembly and testing steps in the chip manufacturing process. The new factory is expected to pay an average annual wage of $51,000, about 46% higher than the state's average of roughly $35,000.For Integra to receive its incentives, it must invest at least $1.5 billion in the new factory in the next five years and consistently provide the equivalent of 1,600 full-time jobs for 10 consecutive years.The incentives are part of a program Kansas created last year to ramp up its efforts to compete with other states for new, large factories. Under that program, the state was allowed to offer up to $1 billion in incentives to a single company each in 2022 and 2023.In July 2022, Kelly and other state officials announced that Panasonic Corp. plans to build a mega-factory to produce electric vehicle batteries for Tesla and other carmakers. The state lured the Japanese electronics giant's project to the edge of the Kansas City area with incentives worth $829 million over 10 years, the most the state has ever offered.The law allowing the incentives required top leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature to sign off any deal between a company and the state Department of Commerce, which is led by Lt. Gov. David Toland, a Democrat like Kelly. The legislative leaders gave their approval just minutes ahead of the announcement, after meeting in private with Kelly for half an hour to review the agreement, with no opportunity for public review or input.The law also requires Kansas to drop its corporate income tax rates by half a percentage point for each mega-deal. If the Integra project goes forward, the top rate would decline to 6% from 7%, saving all corporations roughly $100 million a year.While both mega-projects have had bipartisan support, some lawmakers are critical of promising such big taxpayer-funded incentives to a single firm.\"We have not written the checks for this first project and they're starting the second one without even knowing that it works,\" state Senate tax committee Chair Caryn Tyson, a conservative Republican from eastern Kansas, said before Thursday's announcement.", "abstract": "近日，美国堪萨斯州承诺向芯片厂投资3.04亿美元以吸引联邦资金来建造一座新工厂。这座耗资18亿美元的新工厂将占地100万平方英尺，拥有2000名员工，并为供应商和其他当地企业创造3000个额外的就业岗位。当前，美国正试图扭转芯片生产能力下降的局势。芯片对智能手机、笔记本电脑和其他现代设备，以及汽车和救生医疗设备都至关重要。国会去年批准了一项措施，为半导体行业提供超过520亿美元的拨款和其他激励措施。堪萨斯州州长凯利在州议会新闻发布会上对记者说，该州的激励措施对于吸引联邦资金至关重要，先进制造设施是国家恢复半导体产业的一部分，这样美国工人和企业才能在竞争中获胜。这些激励措施是堪萨斯州去年制定的一项计划的一部分，目的是加大力度与其他州竞争新的大型工厂。根据该计划，该州获准在2022年和2023年分别向一家公司提供高达10亿美元的激励措施。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-kansas-commits-304m-chip-lure.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出新型无铅太阳能材料", "keyword": "无铅太阳能材料 三溴化铯锗 极化 ", "content_zh": "科学家用内置开关种植无铅太阳能材料太阳能电池板，也称为光伏，依靠半导体器件或太阳能电池，将太阳的能量转化为电能。为了发电，太阳能电池需要电场来分离正电荷和负电荷。 为了获得这个领域，制造商通常在太阳能电池中掺杂化学物质，这样器件的一层带正电荷，另一层带负电荷。 这种多层设计确保电子从器件的负侧流向正侧--这是器件稳定性和性能的关键因素。 但是化学掺杂和分层合成也增加了太阳能电池制造的额外成本。现在，由能源部劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室（伯克利实验室）的科学家领导的一个研究小组与加州大学伯克利分校合作，展示了一种独特的变通方法，为太阳能电池制造提供了一种更简单的方法：一种内置电场的晶体太阳能材料--这种特性是由科学家所说的“铁电性”所实现的。 这种材料在今年早些时候发表在《科学进展》杂志上。这种新的铁电材料--由三溴化铯锗(CSGeBr3或CGB)在实验室中生长--为制造太阳能电池器件打开了一扇更容易的大门。 与传统的太阳能材料不同，CGB晶体天生是极化的，晶体的一边积累正电荷，另一边积累负电荷，不需要掺杂。除了铁电，CGB还是一种无铅的“卤化物钙钛矿”，这是一种新兴的太阳能材料，与硅相比，它的价格低廉和易于合成，引起了研究人员的兴趣。 但许多性能最好的卤化物钙钛矿天然含有铅元素。 根据2017年发表在《今日材料能源》上的其他研究人员的说法，钙钛矿太阳能材料生产和处置中的铅残余物可能会污染环境，并引发公共健康问题。 由于这些原因，研究人员寻求了新的卤化物钙钛矿配方，这种配方既不含铅，又不影响性能。“如果你能想象一种无铅太阳能材料不仅从太阳获得能量，而且具有自然自发形成的电场的额外好处--太阳能和电子行业的可能性非常令人兴奋，”联合资深作者杨培东说，他是一位领先的纳米材料专家，以其在一维半导体纳米线用于新型太阳能电池技术和人工光合作用方面的开创性工作而闻名。 他是伯克利实验室材料科学部门的高级教师科学家，也是加州大学伯克利分校的化学和材料科学与工程教授。联合资深作者拉马莫尔西·拉梅什（Ramamoorthy Ramesh）说，CGB还可以推进新一代开关器件、传感器和对光有反应的超稳定存储器，他在研究时拥有伯克利实验室材料科学部门的高级教师科学家和加州大学伯克利分校材料科学与工程教授的头衔，现在是莱斯大学的研究副总裁。钙钛矿太阳膜通常使用低成本的溶液涂层方法制造， 如旋涂或喷墨打印。 与硅不同，硅需要大约2732华氏度的加工温度才能制造成太阳能器件，钙钛矿很容易在室温下从溶液加工到300华氏度左右--对制造商来说，这些较低的加工温度将大大降低能源成本。但是，尽管钙钛矿太阳能材料对太阳能行业有潜在的推动作用，但除非研究人员克服产品合成和稳定性以及材料可持续性方面的长期挑战，否则它们不会上市。固定完美的铁电钙钛矿从三种不同的元素结晶； 每一个钙钛矿晶体都由化学式ABX3描述，大多数钙钛矿太阳能材料不是铁电的，因为它们的晶体原子结构是对称的，就像雪花一样。 在过去的几十年里，像拉梅什和杨这样的可再生能源研究人员一直在寻找具有铁电潜力的奇异钙钛矿--特别是不对称钙钛矿。几年前，第一作者张烨，当时是杨实验室的加州大学伯克利分校研究生研究员，想知道她如何制造无铅铁电钙钛矿。 她的理论是，把锗原子放在钙钛矿的中心会扭曲它的结晶度，足以产生铁电性。 最重要的是，锗基钙钛矿可以释放铅。 （张现在是西北大学的博士后研究员。）但即使张在锗方面有所磨练，仍然存在不确定性。 毕竟，召唤出T ", "content_en": "Scientists grow lead-free solar material with a built-in switchSolar panels, also known as photovoltaics, rely on semiconductor devices, or solar cells, to convert energy from the sun into electricity.To generate electricity, solar cells need an electric field to separate positive charges from negative charges. To get this field, manufacturers typically dope the solar cell with chemicals so that one layer of the device bears a positive charge and another layer a negative charge. This multilayered design ensures that electrons flow from the negative side of a device to the positive side—a key factor in device stability and performance. But chemical doping and layered synthesis also add extra costly steps in solar cell manufacturing.Now, a team of researchers led by scientists at DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), in collaboration with UC Berkeley, have demonstrated a unique workaround that offers a simpler approach to solar cell manufacturing: A crystalline solar material with a built-in electric field—a property enabled by what scientists call \"ferroelectricity.\" The material was reported earlier this year in the journal Science Advances.The new ferroelectric material—which is grown in the lab from cesium germanium tribromide (CsGeBr3 or CGB)—opens the door to an easier approach to making solar cell devices. Unlike conventional solar materials, CGB crystals are inherently polarized, where one side of the crystal builds up positive charges and the other side builds up negative charges, no doping required.In addition to being ferroelectric, CGB is also a lead-free \"halide perovskite,\" an emerging class of solar materials that have intrigued researchers for their affordability and ease of synthesis compared to silicon. But many of the best-performing halide perovskites naturally contain the element lead. According to other researchers publishing in Materials Today Energy in 2017, lead remnants from perovskite solar material production and disposal could contaminate the environment and present public health concerns. For these reasons, researchers have sought new halide perovskite formulations that eschew lead without compromising performance.\"If you can imagine a lead-free solar material that not only harvests energy from the sun but also has the added bonus of having a naturally, spontaneously formed electric field—the possibilities across the solar energy and electronics industries are pretty exciting,\" said co-senior author Peidong Yang, a leading nanomaterials expert known for his pioneering work in one-dimensional semiconducting nanowires for novel solar cell technologies and artificial photosynthesis. He is a senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and a professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering at UC Berkeley.CGB could also advance a new generation of switching devices, sensors, and super-stable memories that respond to light, said co-senior author Ramamoorthy Ramesh, who held titles of senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and professor of materials science and engineering at UC Berkeley at the time of the study and is now vice president of research at Rice University.Perovskite solar films are typically made using low-cost solution-coating methods, such as spin coating or ink jet printing. And unlike silicon, which requires a processing temperature of about 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit to manufacture into a solar device, perovskites are easily processed from solution at room temperature to around 300 degrees Fahrenheit—and for manufacturers, these lower processing temperatures would dramatically reduce energy costs.But despite their potential boost to the solar energy sector, perovskite solar materials won't be market-ready until researchers overcome long-standing challenges in product synthesis and stability, and material sustainability.Pinning down the perfect ferroelectric perovskitePerovskites crystallize from three different elements; and each perovskite crystal is delineated by the chemical formula ABX3Most perovskite solar materials are not ferroelectric because their crystalline atomic structure is symmetrical, like a snowflake. In the past couple of decades, renewable energy researchers like Ramesh and Yang have been on the hunt for exotic perovskites with ferroelectric potential—specifically, asymmetrical perovskites.A few years ago, first author Ye Zhang, who was a UC Berkeley graduate student researcher in Yang's lab at the time, wondered how she could make a lead-free ferroelectric perovskite. She theorized that placing a germanium atom in the center of a perovskite would distort its crystallinity just enough to engender ferroelectricity. On top of that, a germanium-based perovskite would free the material of lead. (Zhang is now a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University.)But even though Zhang had honed in on germanium, there were still uncertainties. After all, conjuring up the best lead-free, ferroelectric perovskite formula is like finding a needle in a haystack. There are thousands of possible formulations.So Yang, Zhang, and team partnered with Sinéad Griffin, a staff scientist in Berkeley Lab's Molecular Foundry and Materials Sciences Division who specializes in the design of new materials for a variety of applications, including quantum computing and microelectronics.With support from the Materials Project, Griffin used supercomputers at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to perform advanced theoretical calculations based on a method known as density-functional theory.Through these calculations, which take atomic structure and chemical species as input and can predict properties such as the electronic structure and ferroelectricity, Griffin and her team zeroed in on CGB, the only all-inorganic perovskite that checked off all the boxes on the researchers' ferroelectric perovskite wish list: Is it asymmetrical? Yes, its atomic structure looks like a rhombohedran, rectangle's crooked cousin. Is it really a perovskite? Yes, its chemical formula—CeGeBr3 –matches the perovskite's telltale structure of ABX3.The researchers theorized that the asymmetric placement of germanium in the center of the crystal would create a potential that, like an electric field, separates positive electrons from negative electrons to produce electricity. But were they right?Measuring CGB's ferroelectric potentialTo find out, Zhang grew tiny nanowires (100 to 1,000 nanometers in diameter) and nanoplates (around 200 to 600 nanometers thick and 10 microns wide) of single-crystalline CGB with exceptional control and precision.\"My lab has been trying to figure out how to replace lead with less toxic materials for many years,\" said Yang. \"Ye developed an amazing technique to grow single-crystal germanium halide perovskites —and it's a beautiful platform for studying ferroelectricity.\"X-ray experiments at the Advanced Light Source revealed CGB's asymmetrical crystalline structure, a signal of ferroelectricity. Electron microscopy experiments led by Xiaoqing Pan at UC Irvine uncovered more evidence of CGB's ferroelectricity: a \"displaced\" atomic structure offset by the germanium center.Meanwhile, electrical measurement experiments carried out in the Ramesh lab by Zhang and Eric Parsonnet, a UC Berkeley physics graduate student researcher and co-author on the study, revealed a switchable polarity in CGB, satisfying yet another requirement for ferroelectricity.But a final experiment—photoconductivity measurements in Yang's UC Berkeley lab—yielded a delightful result, and a surprise. The researchers found that CGB's light absorption is tunable—spanning the spectrum of visible to ultraviolet light (1.6 to 3 electron volts), an ideal range for coaxing high energy conversion efficiencies in a solar cell, Yang said. Such tunability is rarely found in traditional ferroelectrics, he noted.Yang says there is still more work to be done before the CGB material can make its debut in a commercial solar device, but he's excited by their results so far. \"This ferroelectric perovskite material, which is essentially a salt, is surprisingly versatile,\" he said. \"We look forward to testing its true potential in a real photovoltaic device.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国伯克利实验室研究人员开发出一种新型无铅太阳能材料。传统太阳能电池需要在太阳能电池中掺入化学物质，使一层带正电荷，另一层带负电荷，通过这种多层设计确保器件的稳定性和性能，但是化学掺杂和分层合成也增加了太阳能电池的制造成本。为此，研究人员开发出一种新型铁电材料解决了这一问题。这种新型铁电材料是从三溴化铯锗(CsGeBr3或CGB)中培育出来的，与传统太阳能材料不同，CGB晶体本质上是极化的，晶体的一边形成正电荷，另一边形成负电荷，因此不需要任何掺杂，此外这种新型材料中不含有毒物质铅。该研究成果不仅降低了太阳能电池的生产成本，还使太阳能电池的制造变得更加简单。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-scientists-lead-free-solar-material-built-in.html"}, {"title": "德国首次发现声波看破坏光传输互易性", "keyword": "声波 涡流模型 光传输互易性 手征光子晶体光纤", "content_zh": "声波相互破坏光的传播通常情况下，光在两个方向上的传播是一样的：如果我能看到你，你也能看到我。 然而，现在，研究人员发明了一种设备，利用传播声波打破这种对称性，从而减少了反向散射等不必要的光学现象。 这种新设备首次对用于光通信的选择性光学涡旋产生了这种有益的效果，它还可以应用于光镊和基于涡旋的激光器。涡旋在自然界中无处不在--例如在气体、流体、等离子体和DNA中。 在光学旋涡中，一束光的波前绕着光束的中心传播轴旋转，呈螺旋状，中心强度为零。 这种螺旋效应的产生是因为光携带轨道角动量(OAM)。 这种形式的角动量不同于更常见的自旋角动量，自旋角动量表现为偏振，直到1992年才被发现。由于信息可以在OAM中编码，光涡旋显示出很大的前景，这是一个将多个光信号发送到单个光纤上的过程，而干扰或其他有害影响最小。 然而，到目前为止，制造某些涡旋模型只沿一个方向传播的装置一直是一个挑战。 这是由于一个被称为互易的光学基本原理，它意味着光信号将通过光纤在两个方向上自由传播。 这种双向交通可能会导致像后向散射这样的问题，从而降低传输信号的强度。由马克斯·普朗克光科学研究所的曾杏林、菲利普·拉塞尔和比吉特·斯蒂勒领导的小组现在已经使用传播声波来打破选择的涡旋模型中的这种光传输互易性。 在他们的工作中，他们利用声波通过一种称为拓扑选择性受激布里渊-曼德尔斯坦散射的相互作用来操纵手征光子晶体光纤中的光波。 研究人员解释说，当声波沿一个方向传播时，它们自然会导致光声相互作用的非互易行为。 通过这种方式，OAM模式可以被强烈抑制或放大，防止随机后向散射，从而最大限度地减少信号退化。Stiller和他的同事报告说，他们的新器件可以通过调节控制信号的频率来重新配置为放大器或光学涡旋绝缘体。 事实上，他们展示了22分贝的涡旋隔离，这与使用受激布里渊-曼德尔斯塔姆散射的最佳基模隔离器相比较。根据Stiller的说法，该器件的潜在应用包括基于OAM的量子通信和纠缠方案，以及使用OAM模式（基阶和高阶）来增加通信信道容量的经典光通信。 “光和声波选择性操纵涡旋模式的可能性是一个非常迷人的概念，”斯蒂勒说。研究人员在《科学进展》中详细描述了他们的工作，现在计划研究更多具有不寻常结构的奇异声波。 “我们想看看这些波是如何与手性光纤中的光相互作用的，”斯蒂勒告诉《物理世界》。 ", "content_en": "Sound waves break light transmission reciprocityOrdinarily, light transmits the same in both directions: if I can see you, you can see me. Now, however, researchers have created a device that uses travelling sound waves to break this symmetry, thereby reducing unwanted optical phenomena such as backscattering. The new device is the first to produce this beneficial effect for selective optical vortices, which are used in optical communications, and it could also have applications for optical tweezers and vortex-based lasers.Vortices are ubiquitous in nature – in gases, fluids, plasma and DNA, for example. In optical vortices, the wavefront of a beam of light spirals around the beam’s central propagation axis, taking on a helical shape with zero intensity at the core. This spiralling effect comes about because light carries orbital angular momentum (OAM). This form of angular momentum is distinct from the more familiar spin angular momentum, which manifests itself in polarization, and was only discovered in 1992.Because information can be encoded in OAM, optical vortices show much promise for multiplexing, which is the process of sending multiple optical signals down a single fibre with minimal interference or other detrimental effects. As yet, however, it has been challenging to make devices in which certain vortex models propagate in one direction only. This is due to a fundamental principle of optics known as reciprocity, which implies that light signals will propagate freely in both directions through an optical fibre. Such two-way traffic can cause problems like backscattering that reduce the strength of the transmitted signal.Sound waves manipulate optical wavesA team led by Xinglin Zeng, Philip Russel and Birgit Stiller of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light has now used propagating sound waves to break this light transmission reciprocity for chosen vortex models. In their work, they used the sound waves to manipulate optical waves in a chiral photonic crystal fibre via an interaction known as topology-selective stimulated Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering. The researchers explain that as the sound waves travel in one direction, they naturally enable non-reciprocal behaviour for the optoacoustic interaction. In this way, OAM modes can be either strongly suppressed or amplified, preventing random backscattering and thus minimizing signal degradation.Stiller and colleagues report that their new device can be reconfigured as an amplifier or as an optical vortex insulator by adjusting the frequency of the control signal. Indeed, they demonstrated a vortex isolation of 22 decibels, which compares well with the best fundamental mode isolators that use stimulated Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering.According to Stiller, potential applications of the device include OAM-based quantum communication and entanglement schemes as well as classical optical communications that use OAM modes (both fundamental and higher order) to increase the capacity of the communication channels. “The possibility of selective manipulation of vortex modes by light and sound waves [is] a very fascinating concept,” Stiller says.The researchers, who detail their work in Science Advances, now plan to study more exotic sound waves that have unusual structures. “We want to see how they these waves interact with light in chiral optical fibres,” Stiller tells Physics World.", "abstract": "近日，德国马克斯·普朗克量子光学研究所正在尝试开展通过声波打破所选涡流模型光传输互易性的研究。在这项研究工作中，研究人员尝试让声波通过拓扑选择性受激布里渊-曼德尔斯塔姆散射相互作用操纵光子晶体光纤光波。当声波沿一个方向传播时，会自发产生光声相互作用不可逆行为，由此使光携带的轨道角动量模式被强烈抑制或放大，以达到防止随机反向散射的效果，从而最大限度减少信号衰减。而且在调整控制信号频率同时，使用新设备还可以重新配置成为放大器或光学涡旋绝缘体。实验结果表明，实验中展示的22分贝涡流隔离与使用受激布里渊-曼德尔斯塔姆散射的最佳基模隔离器效果相当。该研究为基于光携带轨道角动量的量子通信等潜在应用提供了更好的解决方案，有望大幅提升通信设备信息传输效率，促进光学技术的发展和应用。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/sound-waves-break-light-transmission-reciprocity/"}, {"title": "以色列使用生物传感器使机器人拥有嗅觉", "keyword": "生物传感器 嗅觉 电子系统", "content_zh": "特拉维夫大学的一项新技术使机器人能够使用生物传感器来嗅觉。 传感器发送电信号作为对附近气味存在的反应，机器人可以检测和解释。在这项新的研究中，研究人员成功地将生物传感器连接到电子系统，并使用机器学习算法，能够识别气味，其灵敏度比常用的电子设备高1万倍。 研究人员认为，鉴于他们研究的成功，这项技术未来也可能用于识别爆炸物、药物、疾病等。这项生物和技术突破由特拉维夫大学萨戈尔神经科学学院的博士生内塔·什维尔、弗莱施曼工程学院和萨戈尔神经科学学院的本·毛兹博士以及动物学院和萨戈尔神经科学学院的尤西·约维尔教授和阿米尔·阿亚利教授领导。 这项研究的结果发表在《生物传感器》和《生物电子学》上。 Maoz和Ayali教授解释说，“人造技术仍然无法与数百万年的进化竞争。 我们特别落后于动物世界的一个领域是嗅觉。 这方面的一个例子可以在机场找到，在那里我们通过一个成本数百万美元的磁强计，可以检测我们是否携带任何金属设备。“”但是当他们想检查一名乘客是否走私毒品时，他们会带一只狗来嗅他。 在动物世界中，昆虫擅长接收和处理感官信号。 例如，一只蚊子可以探测到空气中二氧化碳含量的0.01%的差异。 今天，我们远没有生产出能力接近昆虫的传感器。“研究人员指出，一般来说，我们的感觉器官，如眼睛、耳朵和鼻子--以及所有其他动物的感觉器官--使用受体来识别和区分不同的信号。 然后，感觉器官将这些发现转化为电信号，大脑将其解码为信息。 生物传感器的挑战在于将像鼻子这样的感觉器官与知道如何解码从接收器接收的电信号的电子系统连接起来。 Yovel说：“我们连接了生物传感器，让它闻到不同的气味，同时测量每种气味引起的电活动。 该系统使我们能够在昆虫的初级感觉器官水平上检测每一种气味。 然后，在第二步中，我们使用机器学习来创建一个气味的“图书馆”。 在这项研究中，我们能够表征8种气味，如天竺葵、柠檬和杏仁糖，这样我们就可以知道柠檬或杏仁糖的气味是什么时候出现的。“”事实上，实验结束后，我们继续识别额外的不同和不寻常的气味，如各种类型的苏格兰威士忌。 与标准测量设备的比较显示，我们系统中昆虫鼻子的灵敏度比今天使用的设备高约1万倍。“毛兹博士总结道，”大自然比我们先进得多，所以我们应该使用它。 我们所演示的原理可以用于其他感官，如视觉和触觉。 例如，有些动物具有惊人的能力来探测爆炸物或毒品； 一个具有生物鼻子的机器人的发明可以帮助我们保护人类的生命，并以一种今天不可能的方式识别罪犯。 有些动物知道如何检测疾病。 其他人能感觉到地震。 天空是极限。“ ", "content_en": "A robot able to 'smell' using a biological sensorA new technological development by Tel Aviv University has made it possible for a robot to smell using a biological sensor. The sensor sends electrical signals as a response to the presence of a nearby odor, which the robot can detect and interpret.In this new study, the researchers successfully connected the biological sensor to an electronic system and, using a machine learning algorithm, were able to identify odors with a level of sensitivity 10,000 times higher than that of a commonly used electronic device. The researchers believe that in light of the success of their research, this technology may also be used in the future to identify explosives, drugs, diseases, and more.The biological and technological breakthrough was led by doctoral student Neta Shvil of Tel Aviv University's Sagol School of Neuroscience, Dr. Ben Maoz of the Fleischman Faculty of Engineering and the Sagol School of Neuroscience, and Prof. Yossi Yovel and Prof. Amir Ayali of the School of Zoology and the Sagol School of Neuroscience. The results of the study were published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics.Dr. Maoz and Prof. Ayali explain, \"Man-made technologies still can't compete with millions of years of evolution. One area in which we particularly lag behind the animal world is that of smell perception. An example of this can be found at the airport where we go through a magnetometer that costs millions of dollars and can detect if we are carrying any metal devices.\"\"But when they want to check if a passenger is smuggling drugs, they bring in a dog to sniff him. In the animal world, insects excel at receiving and processing sensory signals. A mosquito, for example, can detect a 0.01 percent difference in the level of carbon dioxide in the air. Today, we are far from producing sensors whose capabilities come close to those of insects.\"The researchers point out that, in general, our sensory organs, such as the eye, ear and nose—as well as those of all other animals—use receptors that identify and distinguish between different signals. Then, the sensory organ translates these findings into electrical signals, which the brain decodes as information. The challenge of biosensors is in the connection of a sensory organ, like the nose, to an electronic system that knows how to decode the electrical signals received from the receptors.Prof. Yovel says, \"We connected the biological sensor and let it smell different odors while we measured the electrical activity that each odor induced. The system allowed us to detect each odor at the level of the insect's primary sensory organ. Then, in the second step, we used machine learning to create a 'library' of smells. In the study, we were able to characterize 8 odors, such as geranium, lemon and marzipan, in a way that allowed us to know when the smell of lemon or marzipan was presented.\"\"In fact, after the experiment was over, we continued to identify additional different and unusual smells, such as various types of Scotch whiskey. A comparison with standard measuring devices showed that the sensitivity of the insect's nose in our system is about 10,000 times higher than the devices that are in use today.\"Dr. Maoz concludes, \"Nature is much more advanced than we are, so we should use it. The principle we have demonstrated can be used and applied to other senses, such as sight and touch. For example, some animals have amazing abilities to detect explosives or drugs; the creation of a robot with a biological nose could help us preserve human life and identify criminals in a way that is not possible today. Some animals know how to detect diseases. Others can sense earthquakes.

They are of interest because of their potential for data storage since absence of this external (or \"long range\") magnetic field means the data units—bits—can be packed in more densely within the material.This is in contrast to ferromagnets, used in standard magnetic memory devices. The bits in these devices do generate long-range magnetic fields, which prevent them being packed too closely, because otherwise they would interact.The property that is measured to read out an antiferromagnetic bit is called the Hall effect, which is a voltage that appears perpendicular to the applied current direction. If the spins in the antiferromagnet are all flipped, the Hall voltage changes sign. So one sign of the Hall voltage corresponds to a \"1,\" and the other sign to a \"0\"—the basis of binary code used in all computing systems.Although scientists have known about the Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials for a long time, the effect in antiferromagnets has only been recognized in the past decade or so and is still poorly understood.A team of researchers at the University of Tokyo, in Japan, Cornell and Johns Hopkins Universities in the U.S. and the University of Birmingham in the UK have suggested an explanation for the \"Hall effect\" in a Weyl antiferromagnet (Mn3Sn), a material which has a particularly strong spontaneous Hall effect.Their results, published in Nature Physics, have implications for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets—and therefore for next generation memory storage devices overall.The researchers were interested in Mn3Sn because it is not a perfect antiferromagnet, but does have a weak external magnetic field. The team wanted to find out if this weak magnetic field was responsible for the Hall effect.In their experiment, the team used a device invented by Doctor Clifford Hicks, at the University of Birmingham, who is also a co-author on the paper. The device can be used to apply a tunable stress to the material being tested. By applying this stress to this Weyl antiferromagnet, the researchers observed that the residual external magnetic field increased.If the magnetic field were driving the Hall effect, there would be a corresponding effect on the voltage across the material. The researchers showed that, in fact, the voltage does not change substantially, proving that the magnetic field is not important. Instead, they concluded, the arrangement of spinning electrons within the material is responsible for the Hall effect.Clifford Hicks, co-author on the paper at the University of Birmingham, says that \"these experiments prove that the Hall effect is caused by the quantum interactions between conduction electrons and their spins.

This electronic skin device, comprising only a nanomesh structure that can measure and process bio-signals for a prolonged period, is a big step toward integrated systems for electronic skin devices. The research team, led by professor Lee Sungwon from the Department of physics and chemistry at DGIST, succeeded in developing the world's first ultrathin and breathable nanomesh organic field-effect transistor (OFET) that can be applied to electronic skin devices. Nanomesh OFET, in combination with various sensors, is expected to enable direct measurement of physiological data from the skin surface and optimize data processing.Electronic skin refers to electronic wearable devices worn on the skin to collect biosignals, such as temperature, heart rate, electromyogram, and blood pressure, and transfer the data. In response to the recent increase in interest in smart health care systems with wearable devices, related technologies are being actively developed. A soft sensor that can attach to smooth and constantly moving skin surfaces is required to accurately measure physiological signals using a real-time health care system. As a result, most electronic devices worn on the skin surface have been manufactured using substrates with flat surfaces such as plastic and rubber. However, long-term attachment of substrate with flat surface structure and low liquid and vapor permeability to biological skin can cause unexpected diseases to occur (such as atopy, metabolic disorders, among others). Hence, it is necessary for electronic devices that come in contact with biological tissues to achieve high permeability to ensure long-term use. Accordingly, research on polymer nanofiber-based nanomesh devices with good permeability has been attracting considerable attention. The research team led by Lee Sungwon at DGIST developed an ultra-thin nanomesh OFET that causes almost no discomfort for the users and can be combined with various sensors. In particular, the developed OFET device showed consistent functions even when folded or curved, with almost no performance degradations, even in severe environments such as 1,000 deformations and high humidity.Manufacturing nanomesh transistors was difficult due to the rough surface and lack of mechanical robustness and thermal and chemical stability. Professor Lee Sungwon's team solved these problems simultaneously by using a material called Parylene C as a biocompatible coating.

It was only as a last resort that he had even tried burying microscopic magnetic dots in hardened chunks of sugar — hard candy, basically — and sending these sweet packages to colleagues in a biomedical lab. The sugar dissolves easily in water, freeing the magnetic dots for their studies without leaving any harmful plastics or chemicals behind. By chance, Zabow had left one of these sugar pieces, embedded with arrays of micromagnetic dots, in a beaker, and it did what sugar does with time and heat — it melted, coating the bottom of the beaker in a gooey mess. “No problem,” he thought. He would just dissolve away the sugar, as normal. Except this time when he rinsed out the beaker, the microdots were gone. But they weren’t really missing; instead of releasing into the water, they had been transferred onto the bottom of the glass where they were casting a rainbow reflection. “It was those rainbow colors that really surprised me,” Zabow recalls. The colors indicated that the arrays of microdots had retained their unique pattern.This sweet mess gave him an idea. Could regular table sugar be used to bring the power of microchips to new and unconventional surfaces? Zabow’s findings on this potential transfer printing process were published in Science in its Nov. 25 issue.Semiconductor chips, micropatterned surfaces, and electronics all rely on microprinting, the process of putting precise but minuscule patterns millionths to billionths of a meter wide onto surfaces to give them new properties. Traditionally, these tiny mazes of metals and other materials are printed on flat wafers of silicon. But as the possibilities for semiconductor chips and smart materials expand, these intricate, tiny patterns need to be printed on new, unconventional, non-flat surfaces. Directly printing these patterns on such surfaces is tricky, so scientists transfer prints. There are flexible tapes and plastics that can do the job (like using putty to pick up newsprint), but these solids can still have trouble conforming to sharp curves and corners when the print is laid back down. They could also leave behind plastics or other chemicals that could be hard to remove or be unsafe for biomedical uses. There are liquid techniques, where the transfer material is floated on the surface of water and the target surface is pushed through it. But that can be tricky too; with a freely flowing liquid it can be hard to place the print precisely where you want it on a new surface. But, as Zabow discovered to his surprise, a simple combination of caramelized sugar and corn syrup can do the trick. When dissolved in a small amount of water, this sugar mixture can be poured over micropatterns on a flat surface. Once the water evaporates, the candy hardens and can be lifted away with the pattern embedded. The candy with the print is then placed over the new surface and melted. The sugar/corn syrup combination maintains a high viscosity as it melts, letting the pattern maintain its arrangement as it flows over curves and edges. Then, using water, the sugar can be washed away, leaving just the pattern behind.Using this technique, called REFLEX (REflow-driven FLExible Xfer), microcircuit patterns could be transferred like a stencil to allow scientists or manufacturers to etch and fill the materials they need in the right places. Or, patterned materials could be transferred from their original chip onto fibers or microbeads for potential biomedical or microrobotics studies, or over sharp or curved surfaces within new devices. The technique proved successful for a large range of surfaces, including printing onto the sharp point of a pin, and writing the word “NIST” in microscale gold lettering onto a single strand of human hair. In another example, 1-micrometer-diameter magnetic disks were successfully transferred onto a floss fiber of a milkweed seed. In the presence of a magnet, the magnetically printed fiber reacted, showing the transfer had worked. There’s still more to explore with REFLEX, but this process could open new possibilities for new materials and microstructures across fields from electronics to optics to biomedical engineering.“The semiconductor industry has spent billions of dollars perfecting the printing techniques to create chips we rely on,” Zabow says. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could leverage some of those technologies, expanding the reach of those prints with something as simple and inexpensive as a piece of candy?”", "abstract": "近日，美国国家标准技术研究院开发了一种利用糖混合物在任意共性曲面上进行转印的方法，为电子、光学和生物医学工程等领域开辟新材料和微结构提供了新可能性。目前，传统打印技术无法满足半导体芯片和智能材料领域需要将微小而复杂的的图案印刷在新曲面上的需求。在这项新的研究中，研究人员发现利用焦糖和玉米糖浆的混合物可以解决这个问题。当其溶解于少量水中时，这种糖混合物可以灌浇在平面上的微型图案上，并且在其融化时可以保持高黏度，能使图案在流过曲线和边缘时保持排列。最后再用水把糖洗掉，只留下了图案。这种过程称为回流驱动柔性转印技术，该技术能让微电路图形可以像模板一样被转移，使得科学家或制造商能够在正确的位置蚀刻和填充他们需要的材料。此外，这种图案化材料还可从原始芯片转移到纤维或微珠上，用于潜在的生物医学或微型机器人研究。现在，研究人员已经成功地利用该技术在大头针的尖端上，以及在人类一缕头发上用微缩金色字母印下“NIST”这个单词。", "link": "https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/11/nist-finds-sweet-new-way-print-microchip-patterns-curvy-surfaces"}, {"title": "美国研发出可用于卫星的3D打印等离子传感器", "keyword": "等离子传感器 3D打印 数字化制造 玻璃陶瓷 半导体", "content_zh": "研究人员为卫星制作3D打印传感器麻省理工学院科学家为轨道航天器制造了第一个完全数字化制造的等离子体传感器。 这些等离子体传感器，也被称为延迟电位分析仪(RPAs)，被卫星用来确定大气的化学成分和离子能量分布。3D打印和激光切割的硬件与在洁净室制造的最先进的半导体等离子体传感器一样有效，这使得它们昂贵，需要数周的复杂制造。 相比之下，3D打印的传感器可以在几天内以几十美元的价格生产出来。由于它们成本低，生产速度快，是立方体卫星的理想选择。 这些廉价、低功耗、轻质的卫星经常用于地球高层大气中的通信和环境监测。研究人员使用玻璃陶瓷材料开发了RPAS，这种材料比硅和薄膜涂层等传统传感器材料更耐用。 通过在为用塑料进行3D打印而开发的制造过程中使用玻璃陶瓷，可以制造出形状复杂的传感器，能够承受航天器在低地球轨道上遇到的宽温度波动。“增材制造可以对空间硬件的未来产生很大影响。 有些人认为当你3D打印东西时，你必须降低性能。 但我们已经表明，情况并不总是如此。 有时没有什么可以交换的，“路易斯·费尔南多·委拉斯-加西亚说，他是麻省理工学院微系统技术实验室(MTL)的首席科学家，也是一篇介绍等离子体传感器的论文的资深作者。与委拉斯-加西亚一起发表论文的还有主要作者和MTL博士后哈维尔·伊兹奎多-雷耶斯； 研究生佐伊·毕格罗； 和博士后尼古拉斯·K·卢宾斯基。 这项研究发表在《添加剂制造》上。多功能传感器RPA于1959年首次用于太空任务。 这些传感器探测漂浮在等离子体中的离子或带电粒子的能量，等离子体是地球高层大气中过热的分子混合物。 在像立方体卫星这样的轨道航天器上，这些多功能的仪器测量能量并进行化学分析，可以帮助科学家预测天气或监测气候变化。传感器包含一系列点缀着小孔的带电网格。 当等离子体通过空穴时，电子和其他粒子被剥离，直到只剩下离子。 这些离子产生电流，传感器测量和分析。RPA成功的关键是排列网格的外壳结构。 它必须是电绝缘的，同时也能够承受温度的突然剧烈波动。 研究人员使用了一种可印刷的玻璃陶瓷材料来显示这些特性，被称为Vitrolite。Vitrolite首创于20世纪初，通常用于彩色瓷砖，成为装饰艺术建筑中的常见景观。这种耐用的材料也可以耐受高达800摄氏度的温度而不会分解，而半导体RPAs中使用的聚合物在400摄氏度时开始融化。“当你在洁净室制作这种传感器时，你没有同样的自由度来定义材料和结构以及它们如何相互作用。 使这成为可能的是添加剂制造的最新发展，“Velásquez-García说。重新思考制造陶瓷的3D打印过程通常涉及用激光击打陶瓷粉末以将其融合成形状，但由于激光的高热，这一过程通常会使材料粗糙，并产生弱点。相反，麻省理工学院的研究人员使用了增值税聚合，这是一种几十年前引入的聚合物或树脂添加剂制造过程。 在VAT聚合中，通过反复将其浸入一个液态材料的VAT中，一次构建一层3D结构，在这种情况下是玻璃体。 每加一层后用紫外光对材料进行固化，然后再次将平台淹没在大桶中。 每一层只有100微米厚（大约是一根头发的直径），能够创造光滑、无孔、复杂的陶瓷形状。在数字制造中，设计文件中描述的对象可能非常复杂。 这种精确度使研究人员能够创建具有独特形状的激光切割网格，因此当孔被设置在RPA外壳内时，它们完美地排列在一起。 这使得更多的离子通过，从而导致更高分辨率的测量。由于传感器生产成本低，制造速度快，团队设计了四种独特的设计原型。虽然一种设计在捕捉和测量广泛的等离子体方面特别有效，就像卫星在轨道上会遇到的那样，但另一种设计非常适合传感极其密集和寒冷的等离子体，这些等离子体通常只能使用UltraPre来测量 ", "content_en": "Researchers 3D print sensors for satellitesMIT scientists have created the first completely digitally manufactured plasma sensors for orbiting spacecraft. These plasma sensors, also known as retarding potential analyzers (RPAs), are used by satellites to determine the chemical composition and ion energy distribution of the atmosphere.The 3D-printed and laser-cut hardware performed as well as state-of-the-art semiconductor plasma sensors that are manufactured in a cleanroom, which makes them expensive and requires weeks of intricate fabrication. By contrast, the 3D-printed sensors can be produced for tens of dollars in a matter of days.Due to their low cost and speedy production, the sensors are ideal for CubeSats. These inexpensive, low-power, and lightweight satellites are often used for communication and environmental monitoring in Earth's upper atmosphere.The researchers developed RPAs using a glass-ceramic material that is more durable than traditional sensor materials like silicon and thin-film coatings. By using the glass-ceramic in a fabrication process that was developed for 3D printing with plastics, there were able to create sensors with complex shapes that can withstand the wide temperature swings a spacecraft would encounter in lower Earth orbit.\"Additive manufacturing can make a big difference in the future of space hardware. Some people think that when you 3D-print something, you have to concede less performance. But we've shown that is not always the case. Sometimes there is nothing to trade off,\" says Luis Fernando Velásquez-García, a principal scientist in MIT's Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL) and senior author of a paper presenting the plasma sensors.Joining Velásquez-García on the paper are lead author and MTL postdoc Javier Izquierdo-Reyes; graduate student Zoey Bigelow; and postdoc Nicholas K. Lubinsky. The research is published in Additive Manufacturing.Versatile sensorsAn RPA was first used in a space mission in 1959. The sensors detect the energy in ions, or charged particles, that are floating in plasma, which is a superheated mix of molecules present in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Aboard an orbiting spacecraft like a CubeSat, the versatile instruments measure energy and conduct chemical analyses that can help scientists predict the weather or monitor climate change.The sensors contain a series of electrically charged meshes dotted with tiny holes. As plasma passes through the holes, electrons and other particles are stripped away until only ions remain. These ions create an electric current that the sensor measures and analyzes.Key to the success of an RPA is the housing structure that aligns the meshes. It must be electrically insulating while also able to withstand sudden, drastic swings in temperature. The researchers used a printable, glass-ceramic material that displays these properties, known as Vitrolite.Pioneered in the early 20th century, Vitrolite was often used in colorful tiles that became a common sight in art deco buildings.The durable material can also withstand temperatures as high as 800 degrees Celsius without breaking down, whereas polymers used in semiconductor RPAs start to melt at 400 degrees Celsius.\"When you make this sensor in the cleanroom, you don't have the same degree of freedom to define materials and structures and how they interact together. What made this possible is the latest developments in additive manufacturing,\" Velásquez-García says.Rethinking fabricationThe 3D printing process for ceramics typically involves ceramic powder that is hit with a laser to fuse it into shapes, but this process often leaves the material coarse and creates weak points due to the high heat from the lasers.Instead, the MIT researchers used vat polymerization, a process introduced decades ago for additive manufacturing with polymers or resins. With vat polymerization, a 3D structure is built one layer at a time by submerging it repeatedly into a vat of liquid material, in this case Vitrolite. Ultraviolet light is used to cure the material after each layer is added, and then the platform is submerged in the vat again. Each layer is only 100 microns thick (roughly the diameter of a human hair), enabling the creation of smooth, pore-free, complex ceramic shapes.In digital manufacturing, objects described in a design file can be very intricate. This precision allowed the researchers to create laser-cut meshes with unique shapes so the holes lined up perfectly when they were set inside the RPA housing. This enables more ions to pass through, which leads to higher-resolution measurements.Because the sensors were cheap to produce and could be fabricated so quickly, the team prototyped four unique designs.While one design was especially effective at capturing and measuring a wide range of plasmas, like those a satellite would encounter in orbit, another was well-suited for sensing extremely dense and cold plasmas, which are typically only measurable using ultraprecise semiconductor devices.This high precision could enable 3D-printed sensors for applications in fusion energy research or supersonic flight. The rapid prototyping process could even spur more innovation in satellite and spacecraft design, Velásquez-García adds.\"If you want to innovate, you need to be able to fail and afford the risk. Additive manufacturing is a very different way to make space hardware. I can make space hardware and if it fails, it doesn't matter because I can make a new version very quickly and inexpensively, and really iterate on the design. It is an ideal sandbox for researchers,\" he says.While Velásquez-García is pleased with these sensors, in the future he wants to enhance the fabrication process. Reducing the thickness of layers or pixel size in glass-ceramic vat polymerization could create complex hardware that is even more precise. Moreover, fully additively manufacturing the sensors would make them compatible with in-space manufacturing. He also wants to explore the use of artificial intelligence to optimize sensor design for specific use cases, such as greatly reducing their mass while ensuring they remain structurally sound.", "abstract": "近日，由美国麻省理工学院领导的研究团队研发出一种可用于卫星的3D打印等离子传感器，也是第一个完全数字化制造的等离子传感器。这些等离子体传感器，也称为减速电位分析仪（RPA），由卫星确定大气的化学成分和离子能量分布。在新研究中，研究人员使用玻璃陶瓷材料开发出这款RPA设备，这种材料比硅和薄膜涂层等传统传感器材料更耐用。通过在3D打印制造过程中使用玻璃陶瓷材料，研究人员制造出形状复杂的传感器结构，能承受航天器在近地轨道上可能遇到的大幅度温度波动。由于传感器生产成本低廉，而且可以快速制造，研究人员为传感器设计了两种独特的原型。一种设计在捕捉和测量大范围等离子体方面，类似卫星在轨道上遇到的等离子体一样，而另一种设计非常适合感知极其稠密和寒冷的等离子体，这些等离子体通常只能使用超精密半导体设备进行测量。该研究为研发出用于卫星的等离子传感器提供了新方案，推动了新型传感器设备领域的研究和发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-07-3d-sensors-satellites.html"}, {"title": "德国研发出一种使芯片更快更高效的硅锗制造层系统", "keyword": "芯片技术 硅锗制造层系统 硅锗复合半导体", "content_zh": "由于Germaniumtu Wien（维也纳），更快、更高效的计算机芯片成功地制造了一种可用于芯片技术的新型材料。 这使得更快、更高效的计算机和新型量子设备成为可能。 目前的芯片技术很大程度上是基于硅的。 只有在非常特殊的成分中才加入少量的锗。 但是将来有充分的理由使用更高含量的锗：化合物半导体硅锗在能源效率和可实现的时钟频率方面比今天的硅技术具有决定性的优势。这里的主要问题是以可靠的方式在纳米尺度上建立金属和半导体之间的接触。 使用高比例的锗比使用硅要困难得多。 然而，Tu Wien的研究小组与来自林茨和图恩（瑞士）的研究小组一起，现在表明这个问题可以解决--用极高质量的结晶铝和复杂的硅锗层系统制成的触点。 这使得不同有趣的接触特性成为可能--尤其是对于光电子和量子组件。氧的问题“在传统工艺中，每一个半导体层都自动被污染；这根本无法在原子水平上防止，”图温固态电子研究所的马西亚尔·西斯坦尼说。 首先也是最重要的是，氧原子在材料表面迅速积累--形成氧化层。然而，对于硅来说，这不是一个问题：硅总是形成完全相同的氧化物。 “然而，对于锗，事情要复杂得多，”马西亚尔·西斯坦尼解释道。 “在这种情况下，有一系列不同的氧化物可以形成。 但这意味着不同的纳米电子器件可能有非常不同的表面组成，因此也有不同的电子性质。“如果你现在想把金属触点连接到这些元件上，你就有一个问题：即使你非常努力地以完全相同的方式生产所有这些元件，仍然不可避免地存在巨大的差异--这使得材料在半导体行业中的使用变得复杂。”可重复性是一个大问题，“杜维恩固态电子研究所所长沃尔特·韦伯教授说。 “如果你使用富锗硅锗，你不能确定电子元件在你把触点放在上面后，真的会有你需要的特性。” 因此，这种材料只能在芯片生产中有限地使用，这是一个遗憾，因为硅锗将具有决定性的优势：“电荷载流子浓度更高，尤其是正电荷载流子，即所谓的‘空穴'，在这种材料中比在硅中移动得更有效。 沃尔特·韦伯研究小组的博士生卢卡斯·温德说：“因此，这种材料比我们现在的硅芯片具有更高的时钟频率和更高的能效。”然而，研究小组已经能够展示如何解决这个问题：他们找到了一种在原子尺度上在铝触点和硅锗元件之间建立完美界面的方法。 在第一步中，用薄硅层和实际的电子元件材料--硅--锗来制造层系统。通过以受控的方式加热结构，现在可以在铝和硅之间建立接触：在大约500摄氏度的情况下，发生明显的扩散，原子可以离开自己的位置并开始迁移。 硅和锗原子相对较快地移动到铝接触处，铝填满了空出的空间。“使用的层系统中的扩散动力学因此在铝和硅锗之间建立了一个界面，中间有一个极薄的硅层，”马西亚尔·西斯坦尼解释说。 通过这种制造过程，氧原子永远没有机会到达这种原子锐利和高度纯净的界面。沃尔特·韦伯说：“我们的实验表明，这些接触点可以以可靠和容易复制的方式产生。” “你需要这样做的技术系统今天已经在芯片行业使用。因此，这不仅仅是一个实验室实验，而是一个可以在芯片行业相对快速使用的过程。”所提出的制造工艺的决定性优势是，无论硅锗成分如何，都可以生产高质量的触点。 沃尔特·韦伯说：“我们相信，所呈现的突然、坚固和可靠的金属-半导体接触对于各种新的纳米电子、光电子和量子器件非常有趣。”这项研究发表在《小型》杂志上。 ", "content_en": "Faster and more efficient computer chips thanks to germaniumTU Wien (Vienna) has succeeded in making a new type of material usable for chip technology. This enables faster, more efficient computers and new types of quantum devices. Current chip technology is largely based on silicon. Only in very special components a small amount of germanium is added. But there are good reasons to use higher germanium contents in the future: The compound semiconductor silicon-germanium has decisive advantages over today's silicon technology in terms of energy efficiency and achievable clock frequencies.The main problem here is to establish contacts between metal and semiconductor on a nanoscale in a reliable way. This is much more difficult with a high proportion of germanium than with silicon. The team at TU Wien, however, together with research teams from Linz and Thun (Switzerland), has now shown that this problem can be solved—with contacts made of crystalline aluminum of extremely high quality and a sophisticated silicon germanium layer system. This enables different interesting contact properties—especially for optoelectronic and quantum components.The problem with oxygen\"Every semiconductor layer is automatically contaminated in conventional processes; this simply cannot be prevented at the atomic level,\" says Masiar Sistani from the Institute for Solid State Electronics at TU Wien. First and foremost, it is oxygen atoms that accumulate very quickly on the surface of the materials—an oxide layer is formed.With silicon, however, this is not a problem: silicon always forms exactly the same kind of oxide. \"With germanium, however, things are much more complicated,\" explains Masiar Sistani. \"In this case, there is a whole range of different oxides that can form. But that means that different nanoelectronic devices can have very different surface compositions and therefore different electronic properties.\"If you now want to connect a metallic contact to these components, you have a problem: Even if you try very hard to produce all these components in exactly the same way, there are still inevitably massive differences—and that makes the material complex to handle for use in the semiconductor industry.\"Reproducibility is a big problem,\" says Prof. Walter Weber, the head of the Institute for Solid State Electronics, TU Wien. \"If you use germanium-rich silicon germanium, you can't be sure that the electronic component, after you've put contacts on it, will really have the characteristics you need.\" As a result, this material is only used to a limited extent in chip production.That is a pity, because silicon germanium would have decisive advantages: \"The charge carrier concentration is higher, especially positive charge carriers, the so-called 'holes', can move much more efficiently in this material than in silicon. The material would therefore allow much higher clock frequencies with increased energy efficiency than our current silicon chips,\" says Lukas Wind, a doctoral student in Walter Weber's research group.The 'perfect' interfaceNow, however, the research team has been able to show how the problem can be solved: They found a method to create perfect interfaces between aluminum contacts and silicon germanium components on an atomic scale. In a first step, a layer system is produced with a thin silicon layer and the actual material from which the electronic components are to be made—the silicon-germanium.By heating the structure in a controlled manner, a contact can now be created between the aluminum and the silicon: At around 500 degrees Celsius, distinctive diffusion occurs, the atoms can leave their place and start to migrate. Silicon and germanium atoms move into the aluminum contact relatively quickly, and aluminum fills the vacated space.\"The diffusion dynamics in the layer system used thus create an interface between aluminum and the silicon germanium with an extremely thin silicon layer in between,\" explains Masiar Sistani. Through this manufacturing process, oxygen atoms never have the opportunity to get to this atomically sharp and highly pure interface.\"Our experiments show that these contact points can be produced in a reliable and easily reproducible way,\" says Walter Weber. \"The technological systems you need to do this are already being used in the chip industry today. So, this is not just a laboratory experiment, but a process that could be used relatively quickly in the chip industry.\"The decisive advantage of the presented manufacturing process is that high-quality contacts can be produced regardless of the silicon-germanium composition. \"We are convinced that the presented abrupt, robust and reliable metal-semiconductor contacts are highly interesting for a variety of new nanoelectronic, optoelectronic and quantum devices,\" says Walter Weber.The research was published in Small.", "abstract": "近日，德国维也纳技术大学领导的研究团队研发出一种可用于芯片技术的硅锗制造层系统材料，该材料使得制造更快、更高效的计算机和新型量子设备成为可能。在这项新的研究中，在原子尺度上利用极高质量的结晶铝和复杂的硅锗层系统制成的触点。通过以可控的方式加热该结构，在大约500摄氏度时会发生独特的扩散，原子可以离开原来的位置，开始迁移。硅和锗原子以相对较快的速度进入铝接触点，铝填补空出的空间。在铝和硅锗之间形成了一个界面，中间有一个极薄的硅层，硅锗构成的层系统被制造出来。这种制造过程摆脱了氧原子带来的不利影响。相较于当前主要基于硅的芯片，这种更高锗含量的硅锗复合半导体材料制成的芯片在能源效率和可实现的时钟频率方面具有更高的优势。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-faster-efficient-chips-germanium.html"}, {"title": "德国研发出更加稳定的无人机移动通信网络系统", "keyword": "无人机 移动网络系统 新通信协议 SUCOM移动网络模块", "content_zh": "用移动通信技术可靠地驾驶无人机无人机越来越多地在操控者看不到的地方操作。 然而，常规遥控器的范围有限，不适合这些飞行。 另一方面，简单的基于移动网络的系统到目前为止还不能保证在移动网络负载高或缺乏网络覆盖的情况下可靠的连接。 HHI海因里希-赫兹研究所弗劳恩霍夫电信研究所的研究人员与SUCOM项目的合作伙伴联手开发了一种新的移动网络系统，该系统可以用来控制无人机，即使在长距离和困难的地形上也是如此。通过移动网络通信的自主无人机通常没有稳定的连接。 缺乏网络覆盖是停电的一个原因。 专家还怀疑，在高空作业的无人机可以同时接入太多的小区塔，并在网络小区之间不停切换，这可能导致断线。 另一方面，Fraunhofer HHI的研究人员发现，无人机使用的通信协议以及调节无人机和控制器之间的数据流带来了问题。 因此，Fraunhofer HHI的研究人员与Hessian无人机制造商Wingcopter公司、Emqopter GmbH和CIS GmbH公司联手开发新的通信协议，这些协议对波动的数据流不敏感。 无人机保持连接，即使数据速率波动。 创建航空照片所需的安全关键信息，如位置、高度、飞行方向、速度和其他数据，可以不间断地传输--这是飞行中高安全要求的关键先决条件。最高级别的可靠性“相比之下，我们为无人机配备了商用LTE系统和我们的SUCOM移动网络模块，该模块具有新的通信协议，”弗劳恩霍夫HHI的科学家汤姆·皮埃霍塔说。 “虽然使用传统模块的连接不断中断，但SUCOM模块提供了稳定的连接。多亏了我们的新协议，连接非常稳定，没有中断。” 对这位研究人员来说，这清楚地表明，无人机的中断不仅仅是由于缺乏网络覆盖造成的。SUCOM移动网络模块也可以安装在已经使用的无人机上：例如，在马拉维，配备新模块的无人机在雨季向民众运送药品、血液供应和其他重要物资，覆盖距离高达40公里。 它们从四个机场起飞，每个机场都有一名“远程飞行员”，他将当前路线输入系统，并定义引导无人机的航路点。 只需点击一下就可以将飞行计划发送到无人机上。实现这一目标所需的数据被发送到开普敦的一个服务器，从那里传输到SUCOM模块，然后再传输到无人机上的飞行控制器。 在运输途中，无人机受到远程飞行员的持续实时监控。 无人机还配备了卫星技术，在DSL连接出现故障时可以使用。 如果需要，无人机也可以通过智能手机和VPN连接进行操作。从马拉维到柏林的时间为170毫秒。为了确保无人机和开普敦的服务器之间的数据快速传输，对服务器硬件和软件进行了定制。 现在连接如此之快，以至于马拉维的无人机能够与德国的弗劳恩霍夫HHI实时通信。 数据包通过开普敦的服务器通过移动通信网络从无人机到柏林只需要170毫秒。SUCOM系统还可以为德国的偏远地区提供更好的覆盖。 为了演示这一点，项目组飞越了勃兰登堡州北部的大片森林区域，这是德国最大的网络死角之一，直径达14公里。 这次飞行很成功。 多亏了SUCOM模块，无人机在飞行中的任何时候都没有失去连接。 ", "content_en": "Piloting drones reliably with mobile communication technologyDrones are operating increasingly in areas out of sight of the person controlling them.

A lack of network coverage is one explanation for outages. Experts also suspect that drones operating in high altitudes can access too many cell towers at the same time and keep switching between network cells, which can lead to disconnection. Researchers at Fraunhofer HHI, on the other hand, found that the communication protocols that drones use and that regulate the flow of data between the drone and the controller pose problems. If they are not robust enough for fluctuating data rates, some data packets arrive more slowly, and some are lost altogether.Fraunhofer HHI researchers therefore joined forces with Wingcopter, the Hessian drone manufacturer, Emqopter GmbH and CiS GmbH to develop new communication protocols that are insensitive to jerky data streams. The drone stays connected, even if the data rate fluctuates. Safety-critical information required for the creation of aerial photographs, such as position, altitude, flight direction, speed and other data, can be transmitted without interruption—a key prerequisite for the high safety requirements in aviation.Highest level of reliability\"For comparison, we equipped a drone with a commercially available LTE system and with our SUCOM mobile network module, which has the new communication protocols,\" says Tom Piechotta, a scientist at Fraunhofer HHI. \"While the connection that used the conventional module kept dropping out, the SUCOM module provided a stable connection. Thanks to our new protocols, the connection is so stable that there are no interruptions.\" For the researcher, this is a clear indication that disruptions in drones are not solely caused by a lack of network coverage.The SUCOM mobile network module can also be installed in drones that are already in use: In Malawi, for example, drones equipped with the new module deliver medicines, blood supplies and other vital materials to the population during the rainy season, covering distances of up to 40 kilometers. They take off from four airfields, each of which has a \"remote pilot\" who enters the current route into the system and defines the waypoints that will guide the drone. One click is all it takes to send the flight plan to the drone.The data needed to make this happen is sent to a server in Cape Town, from where it is transmitted to the SUCOM module and then on to the flight controller on the drone. While in transit, the drone is monitored continuously by the remote pilot in real time. The drone is also equipped with satellite technology, which can be used if the DSL connection fails. The drones can also be operated via a smartphone and VPN connection, if needed.From Malawi to Berlin in 170 millisecondsTo ensure the rapid transfer of data between the drone and the server in Cape Town, customizations were made to the server hardware and software. The connection is now so fast that the drones in Malawi are able to communicate with Fraunhofer HHI back in Germany in real time. It only takes 170 milliseconds for a data packet to make its way from the drone to Berlin via the server in Cape Town over a mobile communication network.The SUCOM system could also provide better coverage for remote locations in Germany. To demonstrate this, the project team flew over a large forest area in northern Brandenburg, one of the largest network dead spots in Germany with a diameter of 14 kilometers. The flight was a success. Thanks to the SUCOM module, the drones did not lose connection at any point during the flight.", "abstract": "近日，德国弗劳恩霍夫电信研究院海因里希-赫兹研究所与多家无人机制造商合作开发了一种新的移动通信网络系统，可以在长距离和复杂地形中控制无人机。短程无线电遥控可以满足消费型无人机需要，但远距离无人机主要使用蜂窝网络与运营商进行通信。不过无人机通信可能会在在某些节点缺乏网络覆盖，虽然能够同时访问多个手机信号塔，不断在网络单元之间切换，但频繁的断开连接会造成通信的不稳定。于是，研究团队开发了对不稳定网络数据流不敏感的新通信协议，即SUCOM移动网络模块，可以保持无人机的稳定连接，即使数据速率有所波动。为了进行比较，研究人员为一架无人机配备了商用LTE系统和SUCOM移动网络模块，后者具有新的通信协议。测试结果显示，当传统模块的连接不断掉线时，SUCOM模块提供了稳定的连接。如今，位于马拉维的医疗运送无人机已经在使用这项技术，可以在崎岖的地形上自主飞行，每次飞行距离长达40公里。位于远方的操作员能够随时监控他们的飞行信息。而在手机连接失败的情况下，无人机也支持通过卫星通信系统进行联络。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-drones-reliably-mobile-communication-technology.html"}, {"title": "新加坡研发出用于新硬件设备安全的相变密钥", "keyword": "硬件安全设备 相变密钥 物理不可克隆功能 机器学习", "content_zh": "研究人员为新的硬件安全开发了一种相变密钥随着越来越多的数据被数字化地共享和存储，世界各地发生的数据泄露数量正在上升。 科学家们正在探索新的方法来保护和保护数据免受日益复杂的网络攻击。研究人员使用相变材料开发了一种新型的可重构、可伸缩、低功耗硬件安全设备，对人工智能攻击具有高弹性。 这项研究是由新加坡科技与设计大学(SUTD)的助理教授Desmond Loke领导的，这项研究发表在《高级科学》上。 洛克说，“我们开发了一种新型的硬件安全设备，最终可以实现跨部门和行业的数据保护，因为私人数据的泄露一直在增加。”这种设备被称为物理不可克隆功能(PUF)，是一种新型的相变PUF，与传统的硅PUF相比，它具有可扩展性、更节能和抗AI攻击的安全性。 这是由于相变材料的电学和物理性质，以及制备过程。SUTD研究团队制备了一组在玻璃态非晶态和晶体有序态之间可逆切换的相变器件。 然后，他们利用器件电导的变化来构建PUF，这是由于制造过程中固有的随机性，这是传统硅基器件所没有表现出来的。研究人员模拟了实际相变器件的特性，以生成更多相变基PUF的模拟。 Loke博士和他的团队使用机器学习来测试PUF的安全性，机器学习是一种允许人工智能研究系统并发现新模式的方法。 为了检验人工智能是否可以使用这种训练来预测加密密钥并揭示系统的不安全性，研究人员用相变PUF模拟数据训练人工智能。 洛克补充说，“正常人无法从大量数据中开发出模型，但神经网络可以。我们还发现，加密过程不可能被学习，AI也无法开发出解密相变PUF的模型。”由于潜在的黑客无法使用“被盗”的密钥对未来使用的设备进行反向工程，对机器学习攻击的抵抗使PUF更加安全。 该相变PUF还可以通过重新配置模式立即创建一个新的密钥，如果密钥被损坏，相变PUF可以用于各种应用，具有这些特点，并具有高温操作能力。 未来的研究可以为它在家用设备、可打印和柔性电子设备以及其他设备中的应用铺平道路。 ", "content_en": "Researchers develop a phase-change key for new hardware securityAs more and more data are being shared and stored digitally, the number of data breaches taking place around the world is on the rise.

Unlike the ubiquitous silicon solar panel, they have the potential to be lightweight, flexible, and present a variety of colors, making them particularly attractive for urban or fa?ade applications. However, continued advancements in device performance have been sluggish as researchers work to understand the fundamental processes underlying how organic solar cells operate.Now, engineers at Princeton University and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology have described a new way to express energy loss in organic solar cells and have extended that description to make recommendations for engineering the best devices. This breakthrough could reimagine the conventional approach to constructing organic solar cells. Their work was published on November 18 in Joule.\"There was a way that energy loss in organic solar cells was traditionally described and defined. And it turns out that that description was not wholly correct,\" said Barry Rand, co-author of the study and associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment.Rand pointed out that the traditional method for describing energy loss did not account for the presence of disorder in an organic solar cell. One type of disorder, dynamic disorder, is caused by the erratic movement of molecules at the micro level, leading to energy loss that is practically unavoidable at most temperatures. The other type, structural or static disorder, is a product of the intrinsic structures of the various materials used in an organic solar cell, as well as their arrangement inside a device.Past research on organic solar cells that did not account for disorder in energy loss calculations yielded values around 0.6 electron volts, regardless of the device's materials. But when Rand and his team incorporated disorder into the way they calculated energy loss and tested various devices, they found that the level of disorder played an important role in determining the overall energy loss of an organic solar cell.\"As the disorder of a solar cell increases, we see our non-radiative energy loss component—the component that we have control over—grows rapidly,\" Rand said. \"The non-radiative energy loss grows with the square of the disorder component.\"After demonstrating that increasing disorder causes energy loss to sharply increase in devices, the researchers were able to make recommendations for materials that minimize disorder and therefore lead to more efficient devices. Since scientists can choose the materials they use as well as how to arrange them in an organic solar cell, they have some control over the level of structural disorder in a given device.When engineering an organic solar cell, researchers can focus on creating a homogenous mixture of materials, in which the parts of a film are either all crystalline or all amorphous, or a heterogeneous mixture, in which some parts of a film are crystalline and other parts are amorphous.Through their work, Rand's team demonstrated that when it comes to building organic solar cells, homogeneous mixtures reign supreme. For better-performing organic solar cells, Rand said that scientists should use either highly crystalline or highly amorphous materials and avoid mixing the two within a device.\"If you have anything in between, some heterogeneity in which parts of a film are slightly crystalline and some parts are amorphous, that's when you lose the most energy,\" Rand said.This finding breaks with convention, as researchers previously believed that some level of heterogeneity in solar cell mixtures was beneficial for overall performance. But because Rand's team found that heterogeneous device mixtures had high levels of disorder and lost significant amounts of energy, he said that their discovery could provide new focus for researchers as they pursue more efficient organic solar cells.\"Heterogeneity has often been the focal point of devices. Some level of crystallinity was thought to be beneficial. But it turns out that that's not what we saw,\" said Rand. He pointed out that many of the top-performing organic solar cells today are composed of highly amorphous films, and suggested that with existing technologies, completely amorphous mixtures are more pragmatic than completely crystalline ones.Although his team's research primarily sought to understand the science behind organic solar cells, Rand is hopeful that others can use their work to build more efficient devices and ultimately reach new performance benchmarks for this promising solar technology.\"This discovery is another aspect of organic solar cells that we can add to what we already know, which will help us improve their efficiency going forward,\" Rand said.", "abstract": "近日，美国普林斯顿大学研究团队研发出一种表征有机太阳能电池能量损失的新方法。目前，无论设备采用何种材料，传统描述能量损失的方法都不能解释有机太阳能电池中存在的无序问题，仅能反映出设备产生约0.6电子伏特的能量值。因此，研究人员试图将无序问题研究纳入到计算能量损失和各种设备测试研究中，发现无序程度在决定有机太阳能电池的整体能量损失方面发挥着重要作用。鉴于该发现，研究人员在构建有机太阳能电池时，特意使均质混合物占据主导地位，以获取更高的有机太阳能电池性能。为实现这一目的，研究人员使用高度结晶或高度非晶态材料，并避免在设备中混合使用两种材料，最终发现设备混合物在损失大量能量后具有高无序度。该研究为未来开发更有效的有机太阳能电池奠定了理论基础。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-insights-energy-loss-doors-up-and-coming.html"}, {"title": "美国研发出提高太阳能电池效率和稳定性的新配体", "keyword": "多功能配体 钙钛矿太阳能电池 稳定性 异质结构", "content_zh": "工程师提高太阳能电池效率，稳定普渡大学的研究人员创造了新的多功能配体，提高了钙钛矿太阳能电池的电荷转移、功率转换能力和长期稳定性。钙钛矿是一种可以由不同元素形成的材料，具有多种电、光和物理特性。 钙钛矿可以用类似印刷报纸的简单技术制造成太阳能电池； 钙钛矿太阳能电池板也比硅电池板更薄更轻，运输和安装成本更低。 它们可以轻巧、机械灵活和便携。 但是戴维森化学工程学院的查尔斯·戴维森化学工程副教授杜乐天说，钙钛矿太阳能电池有限制其有效性的特性。“这些太阳能电池缺乏有效的电荷转移，在长时间的光照下不稳定和脆弱，这经常导致降解，”窦说。 “稳定性差意味着产品寿命更短，消费者将需要更频繁地更换面板。钙钛矿可能不像硅那样稳定25年，但成功商业化至少需要10年。更换面板也增加了劳动力成本。”窦说，传统太阳能电池需要钙钛矿和有机电荷收集层之间的关键界面。 他说，需要一种分子“胶水”，但传统分子会阻止电流。窦说：“我们的共轭配体与钙钛矿晶格完美契合，可以帮助构建2D-On-3D钙钛矿异质结构，这进一步提高了太阳能电池板的稳定性。”窦和他的团队在实验室测试了创新的配体。窦说：“我们用配体实现了近25%的功率转换效率，而没有配体时不到20%。” “我们还将在65摄氏度下测试的寿命提高到2400多小时，比没有配体时长四倍。”窦和他的团队正在采取额外的措施来改善配体。窦说：“我们正在研究新的配体，以进一步推进我们已经取得的成就：超过25%的功率转换效率和超过1万小时的工作寿命。” “我们还在努力将配体应用于更大面积的太阳能电池组件。我们希望在一年左右的时间内实现这些目标。”窦向普渡研究基金会技术商业化办公室透露了共轭配体的创新，该办公室已经申请了知识产权专利保护。窦之前的研究发表在2021年7月的《先进材料》和2021年1月的《安格万特化学》上。 ", "content_en": "Engineers improve solar cell efficiency, stabilityPurdue University researchers have created new, multifunctional ligands that improve the charge transfer, power conversion capability and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.Perovskite is a material that can be formed from different elements to have a variety of electrical, optical and physical characteristics.

But a major challenge facing this transition is that the gas is explosive when mixed with air. For this reason, it is crucial to be able to detect hydrogen leaks as early as possible. Now researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Eindhoven University of Technology, have developed an optical sensor that can detect record low levels of hydrogen.Hydrogen is seen as an important part of the decarbonization of the heavy transport sector and around the world hydrogen-powered trains, trucks and airplanes are being developed and deployed. Even in heavy industry, hydrogen is regarded as very important, for example for the production of fossil-free steel.The risks of storing or using hydrogen are well known. Only four percent hydrogen is required in air for the formation of an explosive mixture (knallgas) that can ignite at the slightest spark. Therefore, it is important that ultra-sensitive sensors are in place to monitor leaks and alarm at critical levels.Safety of utmost importance in hydrogen useTogether with Dutch colleagues, researchers at the Department of Physics at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have now developed an optical hydrogen sensor that detects record-low levels of hydrogen. It thus joins the most sensitive sensors in the world. The new research results are presented in an article in Nature Communications.\"Safety is of the utmost importance in all use and storage of hydrogen. If leaks are detected early, they can be fixed so that you hopefully do not have to take the plant or vehicle out of service at all,\" says Chalmers Professor Christoph Langhammer, one of the main authors of the scientific article.AI technology led the wayThe optical hydrogen sensor consists of many metal nanoparticles that work together to detect hydrogen in their surroundings.The approach to how the new sensor was designed differs from what has been done previously. Instead of producing a large number of samples and testing them individually to see which one works best, the researchers have used advanced AI technology to create the optimal interaction between the particles based on their distance to each other, diameter and thickness. The result is a sensor that detects changes in hydrogen concentration that are as small as a few hundred thousandths of a percent.The secret behind the new sensor's low detection limit is the combination of the arrangement of the particles in a regular pattern on a surface and their fine-tuned dimensions. This turned out to be more favorable for the sensitivity of the sensor than the random particle arrangement used in previous sensors of the same type.Christoph Langhammer's research group has previously been able to present the world's fastest hydrogen sensor. For him, it is clear that many different types of sensors are needed and that they have to be optimized for specific applications.\"The technology around hydrogen has taken a giant leap and therefore today's sensors need to be more accurate and tailored for different purposes. Sometimes a very fast sensor is needed, sometimes one is needed that works in a harsh chemical environment or at low temperatures. A single sensor design cannot meet all needs\", says Christoph Langhammer, who is also one of the founders of a new competence center TechForH2.Industry and academia in new collaboration on hydrogenThe new Chalmers-led center brings together both academia and industry to develop new hydrogen technology with focus on the decarbonisation of heavy transport systems. TechForH2 is led by Chalmers Professor Tomas Gr?nstedt at the Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences.\"When the research community and industry merge, it can take us to the next level, such that what we produce can be applied and meet the needs and challenges that exist in the industry. This applies to sensor development, as well as research related to the propulsion of heavy vehicles or airplanes using hydrogen gas,\" says Tomas Gr?nstedt, who mentions that an electric aircraft with a range of 500 kilometers could increase its range to 3000 kilometers if it was powered by hydrogen.How the optical hydrogen sensor worksThe sensor that the researchers have developed is based on an optical phenomenon, plasmons, which occur when metal nanoparticles capture light and give the particles a distinct color. If the nanoparticles are made of palladium or a palladium alloy, their color changes when the amount of hydrogen in the surroundings varies, and the sensor can trigger an alarm if the levels become critical.To find the ultimate combination of the arrangement on the surface and geometry of the particles in the sensor, the researchers used an artificial intelligence algorithm called particle swarm optimization to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to the exposure to hydrogen. Placing the particles in a very precisely defined regular pattern turned out to be the answer.Based on the AI-design, the optimized optical hydrogen sensor was fabricated and verified to be the first of its kind to optically detect hydrogen in the \"parts per billion\" range (250 ppb).The new sensor is based on an optical phenomenon known as \"plasmons,\" which occur when metal nanoparticles capture light and give the particles a distinct color.

This first-of-its-kind bite-controlled optoelectronic system was invented by a research team led by Professor Liu Xiaogang from the Department of Chemistry at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Science, together with collaborators from Tsinghua University.Various assistive technologies such as voice recognition, eye tracking and brain-computer interfaces have been developed in recent years to help people—especially those with limited dexterity or neurological disorders—control electronic devices. However, these technologies have limitations associated with environmental interference, control accuracy, cost and maintenance.To offer a promising alternative to existing assistive technologies, Prof Liu and his team have successfully designed and demonstrated a smart mouthguard containing integrated pressure sensors to detect occlusal patterns. These patterns are translated into data inputs with 98% accuracy, and can be used to control computers, smartphones and wheelchairs.The team's technological breakthrough was published in the journal Nature Electronics on October 10, 2022.Besides supporting human-computer interaction, the interactive mouthguard can also be used for medical assistance, healthcare devices such as smart electronic skin, and dental diagnosis.Limitations of current assistive technologiesAssistive technologies help to promote independence and autonomy for people with disability. Unfortunately, such technologies also have significant drawbacks. For example, voice recognition requires a large operating memory and needs to operate in a low-noise environment, while eye tracking requires a camera to be mounted in front of the user and is prone to fatigue. Although brain–computer interfaces have improved considerably in recent years, this technology is invasive and requires cumbersome wired instruments.Bite force, often used as a parameter to assess masticatory (chewing) function, is a promising area that is not well understood or capitalized. As dental occlusion provides high-precision control and requires minimal skill, Prof Liu and his team came up with a new concept for assistive technology by utilizing unique patterns of occlusal contacts.Translating bite patterns into useful data for device controlThe research team first designed a sensor comprising a series of contact pads containing different colored phosphors—these are substances that emit light in response to pressure. The array of contact pads is placed within a flexible mouthguard.Biting causes the contact pads to mechanically deform and emit light in different colors and intensities, which can be measured and processed using machine learning algorithms. The data collected is then used for high-accuracy remote control and operation of various electronic devices, such as a computer, smartphone and wheelchair.Weighing about 7 grams, the novel mouthguard requires less training experience when compared to existing assistive technologies.\"Our bite-controlled optoelectronic system is capable of translating complex bite patterns into data inputs with 98% accuracy. We have also demonstrated that our novel sensors can distinguish mechanical deformations, including strain, compression and bending, making them applicable to multifunctional mechanical sensing applications, such as miniaturized force sensing, flexible electronics, artificial skin, and dental diagnosis,\" explained Prof Liu.Each smart mouthguard currently costs S$100 (US$70) to produce in the lab, and the team expects the cost to be reduced substantially in mass production. Although the current prototype is designed for well-aligned teeth, a mouthguard with an irregular arrangement of phosphor-infused pads could be developed for users with different tooth patterns or for individuals who wear dentures.The research team has filed a patent for this innovative technology, and they are exploring opportunities to validate their device in a clinical setting, such as care centers or nursing homes.

In the future, scientists anticipate using quantum computing to emulate materials systems, simulate quantum chemistry, and optimize hard tasks, with impacts potentially spanning finance to pharmaceuticals.However, realizing this promise requires resilient and extensible hardware. One challenge in building a large-scale quantum computer is that researchers must find an effective way to interconnect quantum information nodes—smaller-scale processing nodes separated across a computer chip. Because quantum computers are fundamentally different from classical computers, conventional techniques used to communicate electronic information do not directly translate to quantum devices. However, one requirement is certain: Whether via a classical or a quantum interconnect, the carried information must be transmitted and received.To this end, MIT researchers have developed a quantum computing architecture that will enable extensible, high-fidelity communication between superconducting quantum processors. In work published in Nature Physics, MIT researchers demonstrate step one, the deterministic emission of single photons—information carriers—in a user-specified direction. Their method ensures quantum information flows in the correct direction more than 96 percent of the time.Linking several of these modules enables a larger network of quantum processors that are interconnected with one another, no matter their physical separation on a computer chip.\"Quantum interconnects are a crucial step toward modular implementations of larger-scale machines built from smaller individual components,\" says Bharath Kannan Ph.D. '22, co-lead author of a research paper describing this technique.\"The ability to communicate between smaller subsystems will enable a modular architecture for quantum processors, and this may be a simpler way of scaling to larger system sizes compared to the brute-force approach of using a single large and complicated chip,\" Kannan adds.Kannan wrote the paper with co-lead author Aziza Almanakly, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student in the Engineering Quantum Systems group of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) at MIT. The senior author is William D. Oliver, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of physics, an MIT Lincoln Laboratory Fellow, director of the Center for Quantum Engineering, and associate director of RLE.Moving quantum informationIn a conventional classical computer, various components perform different functions, such as memory, computation, etc. Electronic information, encoded and stored as bits (which take the value of 1s or 0s), is shuttled between these components using interconnects, which are wires that move electrons around on a computer processor.But quantum information is more complex. Instead of only holding a value of 0 or 1, quantum information can also be both 0 and 1 simultaneously (a phenomenon known as superposition). Also, quantum information can be carried by particles of light, called photons. These added complexities make quantum information fragile, and it can't be transported simply using conventional protocols.A quantum network links processing nodes using photons that travel through special interconnects known as waveguides. A waveguide can either be unidirectional, and move a photon only to the left or to the right, or it can be bidirectional.Most existing architectures use unidirectional waveguides, which are easier to implement since the direction in which photons travel is easily established. But since each waveguide only moves photons in one direction, more waveguides become necessary as the quantum network expands, which makes this approach difficult to scale. In addition, unidirectional waveguides usually incorporate additional components to enforce the directionality, which introduces communication errors.\"We can get rid of these lossy components if we have a waveguide that can support propagation in both the left and right directions, and a means to choose the direction at will. This 'directional transmission' is what we demonstrated, and it is the first step toward bidirectional communication with much higher fidelities,\" says Kannan.Using their architecture, multiple processing modules can be strung along one waveguide. A remarkable feature the architecture design is that the same module can be used as both a transmitter and a receiver, he says. And photons can be sent and captured by any two modules along a common waveguide.\"We have just one physical connection that can have any number of modules along the way. This is what makes it scalable. Having demonstrated directional photon emission from one module, we are now working on capturing that photon downstream at a second module,\" Almanakly adds.Leveraging quantum propertiesTo accomplish this, the researchers built a module comprising four qubits.Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computers, and are used to store and process quantum information. But qubits can also be used as photon emitters. Adding energy to a qubit causes the qubit to become excited, and then when it de-excites, the qubit will emit the energy in the form of a photon.However, simply connecting one qubit to a waveguide does not ensure directionality. A single qubit emits a photon, but whether it travels to the left or to the right is completely random. To circumvent this problem, the researchers utilize two qubits and a property known as quantum interference to ensure the emitted photon travels in the correct direction.The technique involves preparing the two qubits in an entangled state of single excitation called a Bell state. This quantum-mechanical state comprises two aspects: the left qubit being excited and the right qubit being excited. Both aspects exist simultaneously, but which qubit is excited at a given time is unknown.When the qubits are in this entangled Bell state, the photon is effectively emitted to the waveguide at the two qubit locations simultaneously, and these two \"emission paths\" interfere with each other. Depending on the relative phase within the Bell state, the resulting photon emission must travel to the left or to the right. By preparing the Bell state with the correct phase, the researchers choose the direction in which the photon travels through the waveguide.They can use this same technique, but in reverse, to receive the photon at another module.\"The photon has a certain frequency, a certain energy, and you can prepare a module to receive it by tuning it to the same frequency. If they are not at the same frequency, then the photon will just pass by. It's analogous to tuning a radio to a particular station. If we choose the right radio frequency, we'll pick up the music transmitted at that frequency,\" Almanakly says.The researchers found that their technique achieved more than 96 percent fidelity—this means that if they intended to emit a photon to the right, 96 percent of the time it went to the right.Now that they have used this technique to effectively emit photons in a specific direction, the researchers want to connect multiple modules and use the process to emit and absorb photons. This would be a major step toward the development of a modular architecture that combines many smaller-scale processors into one larger-scale, and more powerful, quantum processor.", "abstract": "近日，美国麻省理工学院开发出一种量子计算架构，可以实现超导量子处理器间的可扩展、高保真通信，作为大型设备链接的桥梁。研究人员首先选择利用单光子在用户指定方向上进行发射，确保量子信息在96%以上的时间内以正确方向流动。其中，通过对几个模块进行连接可搭建出更大的量子处理器网络，保证在计算机芯片上的任何物理分离部分都能彼此互连。其次，研究人员通过使用可支持左右两个方向传播的波导架构串联多个处理模块，使其在同一模块下能同时用作发射器和接收器，最终实现光子发送和捕获。最后，研究人员为更好地利用量子特性，构建出一个包含四个量子位的模块，并利用两个量子比特和量子干涉的特性确保发射光子沿正确方向传播。研究结果表明，该技术在向右发射的光子上实现了超过96%的高保真度。该技术促进了量子科学技术的发展，有望赋予量子计算机更加强大的计算能力。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-quantum-architecture-large-scale-devices.html"}, {"title": "韩国研发出一种由水凝胶制成的鳍推动微型水机器人", "keyword": "水凝胶 鳍推动 微型水机器人 导电纳米粒子 致动器", "content_zh": "将纳米颗粒融入多孔水凝胶中，以最小的电压推动水舱，来自大韩民国的韩国大学、Ajou大学和汉阳大学的研究人员小组创造了一种由浸入纳米颗粒的多孔水凝胶制成的鳍推动的微型水舱。 在他们发表在《科学机器人学》杂志上的论文中，该小组描述了水凝胶如何为一艘小船提供动力，并揭示了需要多少电压。科学家和工程师几年来一直致力于制造用于医疗应用的微型软机器人，并发现水凝胶非常适合这项任务。 不幸的是，这种材料也有不希望的特性，最明显的是，电连接性差。 在这项新的努力中，研究人员采取了一种新的方法来使水凝胶更适合作为电源使用--添加导电纳米颗粒。这项工作包括在多孔水凝胶的一部分中添加少量纳米颗粒，然后将其用作起皱纳米膜电极(WNE)执行器。 添加纳米颗粒可以使水凝胶以可靠的方式导电。 测试表明，执行器可以用3伏特的电力供电。 然后，研究人员将其中两个执行器制作成鳍状形状，并将它们连接到一个微小的塑料身体上。 加在机身上的电子设备控制着发送到鳍上的电力。 由此产生的机器人有一个水虫的外观，漂浮在一个罐子里的水面上。执行器通过传输到夹在水凝胶中的鳍状物中的电极的电流来工作。 这导致在一小部分水凝胶内部产生电渗水流，这反过来控制了溶胀量。 当水凝胶膨胀时，它改变了鳍的形状，从而产生了一种推动力，使微小的水虫在水面上移动。 研究人员指出，致动器的能量密度大于每立方米7×105焦耳。 ", "content_en": "Incorporating nanoparticles into a porous hydrogel to propel an aquabot with minimal voltageA team of researchers from Korea University, Ajou University and Hanyang University, all in the Republic of Korea, has created a tiny aquabot propelled by fins made of a porous hydrogel imbued with nanoparticles.

Those bursts can reveal the activity of electrons attached to an atom's nucleus. But the large amounts of energy carried in those bursts prevent clear observation of the electrons that travel through semiconductors—as in current computers and in materials under exploration for quantum computers.U-M engineers and partners employ two light pulses with energy scales that match that of those movable semiconductor electrons. The first, a pulse of infrared light, puts the electrons into a state that allows them to travel through the material. The second, a lower-energy terahertz pulse, then forces those electrons into controlled head-on collision trajectories. The crashes produce bursts of light, the precise timing of which reveals interactions behind quantum information and exotic quantum materials alike.\"We used two pulses—one that is energetically matched with the state of the electron, and then a second pulse that causes the state to change,\" Kira said. \"We can essentially film how these two pulses change the electron's quantum state and then express that as a function of time.\"The two-pulse sequence allows time measurement with a precision better than one percent of the oscillation period of the terahertz radiation that accelerates the electrons.\"This is really unique and took us many years of development,\" Huber said. \"It is quite unexpected that such high-precision measurements are even possible if you remember how ridiculously short a single oscillation cycle of light is—and our time resolution is one hundred times faster yet.\"Quantum materials could possess robust magnetic, superconductive or superfluid phases, and quantum computing represents the potential for solving problems that would take too long on classical computers. Pushing such quantum capabilities will eventually create solutions to problems that are currently out of our reach.

The result is achieved by optimizing the selection of a dictionary. Algorithms implemented in robotic devices can be used to transmit information through noisy communication channels. The results have been published in the peer-reviewed international scientific journal Mathematics.The task of improving the object (audio, video or electromagnetic signals) classification accuracy, when compiling so-called \"dictionaries\" of devices is faced by developers of different systems aimed to improve the quality of human life.The simplest example is a voice assistant. Audio or video transmission devices for remote control of an object in the line-of-sight zone use a limited set of commands. At the same time, it is important that the commands classifier based on the neural network accurately understands and does not confuse the commands included in the device dictionary. It also means that the recognition accuracy should not fall below a certain value in the presence of extraneous noise.Choosing a limited command dictionary is also very relevant for the brain–computer interface (BCI) that is used to remotely control a robotic arm by people with movement disorders. The device perceives and recognizes patterns of the brain electrical activity when a person thinks about a particular command.The difficulty is that these patterns are similar for words with similar meanings or sounds. In this regard, the classification of mental or other commands from a specific dictionary for the design of the input devices using an audible or electromagnetic signal is a serious problem. However, 16–20 commands are enough to control most robotic devices, and priority is given not to the variety of objects in the dictionary, but to the quality of recognition.The Maximin and Maximal algorithms proposed by Alexandra Bernadotte in her work allow to select a set of dictionary objects to maximize the accuracy of classification while reducing the time for selecting a dictionary of commands by five orders of magnitude compared to the brute-force algorithm.\"Existing algorithms, usually help increasing the accuracy of the classification of the already created dictionary. My aim was to optimize the process of selecting dictionary commands itself. The Maximin algorithm is effective when the dictionary is large enough and you want words to be recognized equally well. The Maximal algorithm is used if we need to increase the accuracy of recognition, and there are significantly more resources for selecting a dictionary.\"The idea of solving the problem is to represent a set of objects (encoded as a sequence of symbols or visual sequences) in the form of a k-partite graph, where each partite of the graph corresponds to a group of objects with a certain common feature (equivalence class). The edges of the graph have weights corresponding to the value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion obtained on the distributions of n-dimensional signals of mental commands belonging to different classes of equivalence—to different partites.\"Finding a clique with the Maximal or Maximin total weight in this graph gives the desired dictionary of commands which are classified with an accuracy not lower than the specified one.

It was only as a last resort that he had even tried burying microscopic magnetic dots in hardened chunks of sugar—hard candy, basically—and sending these sweet packages to colleagues in a biomedical lab. The sugar dissolves easily in water, freeing the magnetic dots for their studies without leaving any harmful plastics or chemicals behind.By chance, Zabow had left one of these sugar pieces, embedded with arrays of micromagnetic dots, in a beaker, and it did what sugar does with time and heat—it melted, coating the bottom of the beaker in a gooey mess.\"No problem,\" he thought. He would just dissolve away the sugar, as normal. Except this time when he rinsed out the beaker, the microdots were gone. But they weren't really missing; instead of releasing into the water, they had been transferred onto the bottom of the glass where they were casting a rainbow reflection.\"It was those rainbow colors that really surprised me,\" Zabow recalls. The colors indicated that the arrays of microdots had retained their unique pattern.This sweet mess gave him an idea. Could regular table sugar be used to bring the power of microchips to new and unconventional surfaces? Zabow's findings on this potential transfer printing process were published in Science on Nov. 25.Semiconductor chips, micropatterned surfaces, and electronics all rely on microprinting, the process of putting precise but minuscule patterns millionths to billionths of a meter wide onto surfaces to give them new properties. Traditionally, these tiny mazes of metals and other materials are printed on flat wafers of silicon. But as the possibilities for semiconductor chips and smart materials expand, these intricate, tiny patterns need to be printed on new, unconventional, non-flat surfaces.Directly printing these patterns on such surfaces is tricky, so scientists transfer prints. There are flexible tapes and plastics that can do the job (like using putty to pick up newsprint), but these solids can still have trouble conforming to sharp curves and corners when the print is laid back down. They could also leave behind plastics or other chemicals that could be hard to remove or be unsafe for biomedical uses.There are liquid techniques, where the transfer material is floated on the surface of water and the target surface is pushed through it. But that can be tricky too; with a freely flowing liquid it can be hard to place the print precisely where you want it on a new surface.But, as Zabow discovered to his surprise, a simple combination of caramelized sugar and corn syrup can do the trick.When dissolved in a small amount of water, this sugar mixture can be poured over micropatterns on a flat surface. Once the water evaporates, the candy hardens and can be lifted away with the pattern embedded. The candy with the print is then placed over the new surface and melted. The sugar/corn syrup combination maintains a high viscosity as it melts, letting the pattern maintain its arrangement as it flows over curves and edges. Then, using water, the sugar can be washed away, leaving just the pattern behind.Using this technique, called REFLEX (REflow-driven FLExible Xfer), microcircuit patterns could be transferred like a stencil to allow scientists or manufacturers to etch and fill the materials they need in the right places. Alternatively, patterned materials could be transferred from their original chip onto fibers or microbeads for potential biomedical or microrobotics studies, or over sharp or curved surfaces within new devices.The technique proved successful for a large range of surfaces, including printing onto the sharp point of a pin, and writing the word \"NIST\" in microscale gold lettering onto a single strand of human hair. In another example, 1-micrometer-diameter magnetic disks were successfully transferred onto a floss fiber of a milkweed seed. In the presence of a magnet, the magnetically printed fiber reacted, showing the transfer had worked.There's still more to explore with REFLEX, but this process could open new possibilities for new materials and microstructures across fields from electronics to optics to biomedical engineering.\"The semiconductor industry has spent billions of dollars perfecting the printing techniques to create chips we rely on,\" Zabow says. \"Wouldn't it be nice if we could leverage some of those technologies, expanding the reach of those prints with something as simple and inexpensive as a piece of candy?\"", "abstract": "近日，美国国家标准技术研究院开发了一种利用糖在几乎任意共性表面上进行转印的方法。目前，在非传统曲面上打印复杂、微小图案的转印技术，仍无法精确的将图案转移到更普遍的任意曲率的表面，研究人员利用焦糖和玉米糖浆的简单组合解决了这一难题。当溶解在少量水中时，这种糖混合物可以灌浇在平面上的微型图案上。一旦水分蒸发，糖果就会变硬，并可以在嵌入图案的情况下被掀开。然后将印有图案的糖果放在新的表面上并融化。糖和玉米糖浆的组合在融化时保持高黏度，使图案在流过曲线和边缘时保持其排列。接着用水把糖洗掉，只留下了图案。使用这种名为“回流驱动柔性转印”的技术，微电路图形可以像模板一样被转移，科学家或制造商能够在正确的位置蚀刻和填充他们需要的材料。图案化材料可从原始芯片转移到纤维或微珠上，用于潜在的生物医学或微型机器人研究，或者转移到新设备的尖锐或弯曲的表面上。该技术为电子、光学和生物医学工程等领域开辟新材料和微结构提供了新的可能性。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-sweet-microchip-patterns-curvy-surfaces.html"}, {"title": "香港实现III-V半导体器件和硅组件之间的有效耦合", "keyword": "III-V半导体器件 硅组件 有效耦合 光电探测器", "content_zh": "香港科技大学研究人员开发出一种新的集成方案，在硅光子学（Si-Photonics）平台上，通过选择性直接外延，将III-V化合物半导体器件与硅元件有效耦合。他们表示，他们的方法释放了将高能效光子学与低成本电子学集成的潜力，并使下一代电信系统具有低成本、高速和大容量。虽然硅基无源元件已在硅光子学平台上建立良好， 硅材料无法实现激光和光电探测器，需要集成其他材料，如硅基III-V族化合物半导体。研究硅基III-V族激光器和光电探测器主要有两种方法。 第一种是基于键合的方法，它产生了性能令人印象深刻的器件。 然而，它需要复杂的制造工艺，成品率低，成本高，使得大规模生产非常困难。 另一种方法是直接外延法，通过在硅上生长多层III-V。虽然它提供了一种成本更低、可扩展性更大和集成密度更高的解决方案，但对该方法至关重要的微米厚的III-V缓冲层阻碍了III-V和硅之间的有效光耦合--这是集成硅光子学的关键。为了解决这些问题，刘启梅领导的团队， 香港科技大学电子及电脑工程学系荣休教授发展横向深宽比俘获(LART)--一种新的选择性直接外延方法，可在绝缘体上硅(SOI)上选择性地在横向生长III-V材料，而无需厚缓冲层。此外，基于这项新技术，团队设计并展示了独特的III-V光电探测器和硅元件的面内集成，并在III-V与硅之间实现了高耦合效率。与商业探测器相比，这种方法的光电探测器性能更低噪音、更灵敏， 操作范围更广，速度超过112Gb/s，比现有产品快得多。 首次采用直接外延的方法实现了III-V器件与Si元素的高效耦合。 这种集成策略可以很容易地应用于各种III-V器件和硅基器件的集成，从而实现在硅光子学平台上集成光子学和电子学的最终目标，用于数据通信。“这是由于我们最新开发的一种名为横向长宽比陷阱(LART)的新型生长技术和我们在SOI平台上独特的耦合策略设计而成为可能的。 刘教授说：“我们的团队在器件物理和生长机制方面的专业知识和洞察力使我们能够完成III-V和Si之间的有效耦合，以及外延生长和器件性能的互相关分析。这项工作将为光子集成电路和完全集成的Si光子学提供实用的解决方案，通过这种方法可以实现III-V激光器和Si组件之间的光耦合。” 是项研究的第一作者。这项研究是与香港中文大学电子工程学系曾汉基教授及中山大学电子及资讯科技学院蔡信伦领导的研究小组合作完成的。研究中的器件制造技术是在香港科技大学清水湾校区的纳米系统制造设施(NFF)开发的。 有关工作获香港研究资助局及香港创新科技基金资助。 这项工作最近发表在Optica上。 ", "content_en": "HKUST team develops way to couple III-V and siliconsResearchers at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has developed a novel integration scheme for efficient coupling between III-V compound semiconductor devices and silicon components on silicon photonics (Si-photonics) platform by selective direct epitaxy.They say their method unlocks the potential of integrating energy-efficient photonics with cost-effective electronics, as well as enabling the next generation telecommunications with low cost, high speed and large capacity.While silicon-based passive components have been well established on Si-photonics platform, the lasers and photodetectors can’t be realized by silicon and necessitate the integration of other materials such as III-V compound semiconductors on silicon.III-V lasers and photodetectors on silicon has been investigated by two main methods. The first one is the bonding-based method which has yielded devices with impressive performance. However, it requires complicated manufacturing technique that is low yield and high-cost, making mass production very challenging. The other way is direct epitaxy method by growing multiple layers of III-V on silicon.While it provides a solution with lower cost, larger scalability and higher integration density, the micrometers thick III-V buffer layers which are crucial for this method hinders efficient light coupling between III-V and silicon - the key for integrated Si-photonics.To address these issues, the team led by Kei-May LAU, professor emeritus of the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) developed lateral aspect ratio trapping (LART) - a novel selective direct epitaxy method that can selectively grow III-V materials on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) in a lateral direction without the need of thick buffers.Furthermore, based on this novel technology, the team devised and demonstrated unique in-plane integration of III-V photodetectors and silicon elements with high coupling efficiency between III-V and silicon.Compared to the commercial ones, the performance of photodetectors by such approach is less noisy, more sensitive, and has wider operation range, with record-high speed of over 112 Gb/s – way faster than existing products. For the first time, the III-V devices can be efficiently coupled with Si elements by direct epitaxy. The integration strategy can be easily applied to the integration of various III-V devices and Si-based components, thereby enabling the ultimate goal of integrating photonics with electronics on silicon photonics platform for data communications.“This was made possible by our latest development of a novel growth technique named lateral aspect ratio trapping (LART) and our unique design of coupling strategy on the SOI platform.

Engineers have nearly reached the limits of traditional electronics and are now in the process of transitioning from electronics to photonics, using light instead of electrons. At this scale, all kinds of new challenges arise. For example, the smallest interferences or quantum effects can distort signals and render them unusable. Now, a research team from the University of Twente have added a new solution to the photonic toolbox.The filtering, amplifying and processing of optical signals is essential in the development of new telecommunication techniques, quantum optics and sensors. One pathway to do this effectively is by using a coherent optomechanical interaction technique called stimulated Brillouin scattering. In this technique, two finely tuned lasers generate a soundwave with frequencies 1 million times higher than the human hearing threshold and trap it in a waveguide. Light sent through the waveguide interacts with the soundwave, which will reflect a very small and specific part of the light spectrum; effectively filtering the signal.\"Even though Brillouin scattering has been studied extensively in the last few years, it could never be implemented reliably on a chip suitable for use in our daily lives,\" tells Prof David Marpaung, professor leading the Nonlinear Nanophotonics research group. \"Trapping the soundwave in a waveguide long enough to be effective, has proven to be very difficult. 'Acoustic leakage' is a big problem in traditional silicon-based platforms preventing strong Brillouin interactions. And alternative materials are often unstable, fragile, or even toxic.\"Breakthrough with multilayer silicon nitride waveguideThe research team at the University of Twente has used low-loss multilayer silicon nitride (Si3N4) nanophotonic circuits to confine both the optical and the acoustic waves. These circuits consist of 50 cm-long spiral waveguides. This setup traps the soundwave and prevents the acoustic leakage that occurs when using a single silicon nitride core. Besides promising results in their experimental setup, the researchers produced a working proof of concept and other practical implementations. Roel Botter, first author of the paper, says, \"We demonstrated an RF cancelation notch filter, and the results show great potential for future stimulated Brillouin scattering on a silicon nitride chip.\"Marpaung adds, \"Our research makes integration of stimulated Brillouin scattering in large circuits possible. These new chips can be integrated with other emerging technologies such as tunable lasers, frequency combs, and programmable photonic circuits, potentially giving them a part in the future development of fields ranging from telecommunications to quantum computing.\"The research paper, published on Oct. 7 in Science Advances, is the result of a 4-year study on the feasibility of stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon nitride photonic circuits.

The method is reported in Carbon and involves making briquettes—dense packages of carbon nanotube powders. Nanocomposites made with briquettes perform equally well as those made from the more expensive masterbatches, which are also polymer-specific—that is, less versatile.\"We believe the use of dense briquettes of carbon nanotubes can significantly facilitate the development of the carbon nanotube composite industry. This technique is cheap and applicable to a broad variety of polymer matrices, without sacrificing any of the electrical and thermal properties of the final material,\" the lead author of the study, Skoltech Ph.D. student Hassaan Butt, stated.Carbon nanotubes have been intensively investigated for decades by researchers from academia and industry because of their unique combination of electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Meanwhile, polymer-based nanocomposites have come to be the largest carbon nanotube application and the one closest to widespread integration into everyday life. It is easy to understand why: The smallest amounts of nanotubes added to a polymer endow the material with fundamentally new properties, such as electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity, as well as crucially enhancing its thermal and mechanical properties.The recent study in Carbon began as an attempt to address the challenge of achieving sufficient carbon nanotube dispersion within a host polymer to attain optimal composite properties. To this end, Skoltech researchers and their collaborators from Kurnakov Institute investigated the method for rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) of nanotubes, which leads to their deagglomeration. However, it did not yield any improvements in the ultimate properties of polymer nanocomposites. The team decided to explore the implications of this from the opposite perspective.Study co-author and one of the main contributors, Skoltech Ph.D. student Ilya Novikov, explained: \"Having realized that rapid expansion produces a tenfold decrease in the bulk density of the nanotubes but does not improve composite properties, we thought, why don't we do the opposite thing and compress the powders instead. What if compression does not impair the material's performance?\" The reason this would be exciting, he added, is that higher density means greater convenience and fewer safety hazards in manufacture due to unwanted nanotube aerosolization.This way the authors switched to a completely different line of work, and the study came to be focused on the effect of carbon nanotube powder density, or preconsolidation degree, on composite functional properties. To increase bulk density, the researchers pneumatically compressed pristine nanotube powders.After this, the team thoroughly investigated the properties of epoxy nanocomposites fabricated from four types of carbon nanotube powders: expanded (RESS), pristine, compressed (briquette-shaped), and commercial masterbatches—the latter are nanotubes additionally predispersed in the polymer by the manufacturer. Unexpectedly, all the studied properties, including morphology, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and stability, proved to be the same, regardless of nanotube bulk density.\"Surprisingly, we found that the electrical behavior was actually identical for all the obtained composites. Then we revealed the same for thermal properties. We attributed this to similar spatial distribution of the nanotubes in epoxy. What's most remarkable here is that the quite expensive and polymer-specific commercial masterbatch turns out to provide the same properties as our briquettes. Moreover, on the other hand, they are much easier and safer to handle, compared to pristine and expanded powders,\" the study's principal investigator, Skoltech Professor Albert Nasibulin,said.Carbon nanotubes are such an ultralight material that aerosolization and the associated safety risks for the personnel are an essential problem for nanocomposite production. It can be avoided, the authors propose, by utilizing briquettes, which thus amount to a cheap, simple, and scalable solution for simplifying the use of carbon nanotubes in the laboratories of academia and industry, which sprang from an attempt to address a completely different issue.", "abstract": "近日，俄罗斯斯科尔科沃科技学院开发出使用碳纳米管来制造聚合物纳米复合材料的新方法，该方法主要依赖于不同密度的碳纳米管粉末。该团队主要研究了四种不同密度的碳纳米管粉末制成的环氧纳米复合材料的性能，结果表明这四种单壁碳纳米管制成的环氧纳米复合材料的形态、导电性，导热性和稳定性都是相同的，并且与纳米管的体密度无关。此外，他们发现这些复合材料不仅拥有相同的电性能，还有相同的热性能，这主要是由于纳米管在环氧树脂中具有相似的空间分布。该研究有助于更好的促进碳纳米管复合材料行业的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-scientists-easier-safer-carbon-nanotubes.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出DDR5内存接口芯片", "keyword": "DDR5 温度传感器SPD集线器 内存带宽", "content_zh": "Rambus为数据中心服务器旋转DDR5 DIMM接口ICs在其DDR5产品组合中增加了SPD（串行存在检测）集线器和温度传感器ICs，Rambus现在有了一个完整的DDR5 DIMM接口芯片组。为PC和数据中心服务器打开大门，以更好地利用DDR5 DRAM，昨天Rambus宣布将SPD（串行存在检测）集线器和温度传感器芯片用作DDR5内存模块芯片组的一部分。这一声明与该公司今天直播的第三届年度Rambus设计峰会2022虚拟活动相一致。在本文中， 我们深入探讨了新芯片的细节，研究了DDR4和DDR5 DRAM之间的关键差异，并分享了我们采访Rambus内存接口芯片产品营销副总裁John Eble时的见解。HUB和传感器完成了DDR5接口芯片组这两个新芯片--SPD集线器和温度传感器补充了Rambus的DDR5寄存器时钟驱动器(RCD)芯片，这三个器件共同构成了DDR5内存模块的接口芯片组。 DDR5 RCD IC早在2021年10月就宣布了。根据Rambus的说法，SPD集线器和温度传感器是DDR5内存模块上的关键设备，用于感知并向主机处理器报告系统配置和热管理的重要数据。SPD集线器设计用于服务器和客户机内存模块，包括SODIMM、UDIMM和RDIMM。 同时，温度传感器是为服务器RDIMM设计的。服务器需求和DDR5标准由于DRAM标准多年来一直存在，新的标准必须与当前和未来的计算趋势保持一致。 例如，Elbe说，DDR5的前身DDR4已经存在了近10年，预计至少还会存在10年。Elbe说，内存容量和传输带宽当然仍然是DDR标准中最基本的要求。 在处理器方面，我们已经过了CPU厂商在时钟速度、IPC（处理器间通信）和线程上争斗的时代。 易北人说，现在一切都是为了增加处理器核心的数量。“现在的大趋势是关于你可以打包到处理器套接字中的核心数量。现在内存带宽容量必须与核心数量成比例地扩展。我认为这正是推动新DDR5标准的原因。”另一个棘手的要求是让服务器保持与以前标准相同的内存访问粒度。 这意味着以64字节的缓存行为基础进行内存事务。根据Elbe的说法，另一个要求是你需要对DRAM模块有一个非常低的错误率，你需要能够从错误中恢复或知道何时发生错误。这意味着要在模块崩溃时幸存下来，必须同时纠正单个错误和检测双重错误。 Elbe说，能够从中恢复也是一个要求。随着处理器的竞争越来越快，散热是一个持续的挑战。 数据中心服务器设计需要消除热量，并保持在其电源范围内。 Elbe说，DIMM通常被设计为每台约15瓦，这仍然是基于DDR5的设计的目标。“我们需要提高效率，以便当我们进入更高的存储器带宽时，功率或多或少保持不变，”他说。 温度传感器有助于实现这一目标。 使用这种传感器在DDR系统中并不新鲜，但在DDR5时代，它们有了新的重要性。根据易北人的说法，你在这些高级内存接口中看到的另一个关键需求是，它们需要大量的“培训”。在这种情况下，培训意味着当系统启动时需要大量的设置，这些步骤需要在合理的时间内完成。 Elbe说，这是DDR5从I2C转向更快的I3C作为信号接口的一个关键原因。DDR4和DDR5之间的差异除了支持更快的数据速率和时钟速率之外，DDR5标准还提供了几个与其前身DDR4之间的关键差异。 下表描述了这些差异。 重要的是，虽然DDR4是每个DIMM一个通道的架构，但DDR5实现了每个DIMM两个通道。 从内存控制器的角度来看，这个额外的通道给了你一定程度的并行性，Elbe说。 “效率和处理高负载的能力很重要。 所以在加载的情况下，你应该看到DDR5更好的延迟，“他说。根据易北人的说法，DDR5中CA（命令/地址）总线的变化是一个大问题。 使用分组化协议实现每通道CA总线10位DDR。 这提供了足够的CA带宽，可以在较少数量的DIMM引脚中启用两个通道。Elbe说，DDR5的真正容量增长来自于将单个芯片封装DRAM的最大尺寸从16 GB增加到64 GB。 这意味着，对于X4 DIMM的双存储库，DIMM的最大容量将从64 GB移动到256 GB。 如果你需要更多 ", "content_en": "Rambus Spins DDR5 DIMM Interface ICs for Data Center ServersAdding SPD (serial presence detect) hub and temperature sensor ICs to its DDR5 portfolio, Rambus now has a complete chipset offering for DDR5 DIMM interfacing.Opening the door for PCs and data center servers to better take advantage of DDR5 DRAM, yesterday Rambus announced SPD (serial presence detect) hub and temperature sensor chips to be used as part of a DDR5 memory module chipset.The announcement aligns with the company’s 3rd annual Rambus Design Summit 2022 virtual event, which is live today.In this article, we dive into the details of the new chips, examine the key differences between DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM, and share insights from our interview with John Eble, vice president of product marketing for memory interface chips at Rambus.Hub and Sensors Complete the DDR5 Interface ChipsetThe two new chips—the SPD Hub and the Temperature Sensor complement Rambus’ DDR5 Registering Clock Driver (RCD) chip, and together the three devices form an interface chipset for DDR5 memory modules. The DDR5 RCD IC was announced back in October 2021.According to Rambus the SPD Hub and Temperature Sensor are key devices on a DDR5 memory module in order to sense and report important data for system configuration and thermal management back to the host processor.The SPD Hub is designed to be used in both server and client memory modules, including SODIMMS, UDIMMs, and RDIMMs. Meanwhile, the temperature sensor is designed for use in server RDIMMs.Server Demands and the DDR5 StandardBecause DRAM standards tend to stick around for many years, new standards have to be aligned with both current and future computing trends. DDR5’s predecessor DDR4, for example, has been around for almost 10 years, says Elbe, and is expected to be around for at least 10 more.Memory capacity and transfer bandwidth, of course, remain the most fundamental requirements in DDR standards, says Elbe. On the processor side, we’re past the era of CPU vendors battling on clock speeds, IPC (inter-processor communication), and threading. Now it’s all about scaling up the number of processor cores, says Elbe.\"The megatrend now is all about the number of cores you can pack into a processor socket. Now the memory bandwidth capacity has to scale proportionally to the number of cores. And that's really what I think is driving the new DDR5 standard.\"Another tricky requirement is to enable servers to maintain the same memory access granularity as the previous standard. That means doing memory transactions on a cache line basis at 64 bytes.Another demand, according to Elbe, is that you need to have a very low error rate with your DRAM modules, and you need to be able to either recover from the error or know when there's an error.That means having both single errors correct and dual error detect is a must to be able to survive one of the DRAMs on a module going down. Being able to recover from that is also a requirement, says Elbe.As processors race ever faster, heat dissipation is an ongoing challenge. Data center server designs need to remove heat, and stay within their power envelope. DIMMs are typically designed to be about 15 W per DIMM and that continues to be the target in DDR5-based designs, says Elbe.“We need to increase efficiency so that, as we go to higher memory bandwidths, the power stays more or less constant,” he says. Temperature sensors help facilitate that. Using such sensors isn’t new in DDR systems, but in the DDR5 era they take on new importance.According to Elbe, another key demand you see with these advanced memory interfaces is that they require a lot of “training.” Training in this context means that there’s a lot of setup required when the system boots up, and those steps need to be done in a reasonable amount of time. That’s a key reason why DDR5 moved from I2C to the faster I3C as its signal interface, says Elbe.Differences Between DDR4 and DDR5Aside from supporting faster data rates and clock rates, the DDR5 standard offers several key differences between it and its predecessor DDR4. The table below describes these differences. Importantly, while DDR4 is a single channel per DIMM architecture, DDR5 implements 2 channels per DIMM. That extra channel gives you a degree of parallelism from the memory controller perspective, says Elbe. “Efficiency and the ability to handle high loads are important. So in a loaded situation, you should see better latency from DDR5,” he says.The changes to the CA (command/address) bus in DDR5 are a big deal, according to Elbe. A 10-bit DDR per channel CA bus is implemented using a packetized protocol. This provides enough CA bandwidth to enable two channels in a smaller number of DIMM pins.Elbe says the real capacity increases for DDR5 come from increasing the maximum size of a single die package DRAM from 16 Gb up to 64 Gb. That means that, for a dual bank of x4 DIMMs, the maximum DIMM capacity would move from 64 GB to 256 GB. And if you need more than that, Elbe points out there are DRAM suppliers building stacked configurations of DRAM. And the addressing scheme moves from a maximum of eight high to 16 high for DDR5, he says.Power efficiency is also increased in DDR5. In DDR5, the I/O voltages are reduced from 1.2 V to 1.1 V. Meanwhile, in DDR5 the CA bus has changed from SSTL style signaling to PODL (pseudo open drain logic), which is the same as the data bus. “That has the nice feature of, when all the bits are parked high, you draw no static power from the transmission line,” says Elbe.Details: SPD Hub and Temperature Sensor ICsAccording to Elbe, the new chipset—consisting of the new SPD Hub and Temperature Sensor, plus the previously announced RCD IC—represents a new approach to memory module interfacing for Rambus. Up until now, he says, the company’s memory interface business focused on signal integrity chips that helped increase the bandwidth of the memory module. This new chipset takes a more system-level approach to improve performance and support the DDR standard, in this case, DDR5.For its part, the SPD Hub chips are the devices that JEDEC has defined for DDR5. According to Elbe, the SPD Hub meets or exceeds all JEDEC DDR5 SPD Hub operational requirements (per JEDEC spec JESD300-5A).Features of new the SPD Hub (SPD5118) include:I2C and I3C bus serial interface supportExpanded NVM (non-volatile memory) space for customer-specific applicationsLow latency to maximize I3C bus ratesIntegrated temperature sensor“SPD, which stands for ‘serial presence detect,’ has been on previous JEDEC DDR standards,” says Elbe, “But this new device is a bit of a Swiss Army knife and acts as a kind of a gateway to the module.” Like past SPD devices, it contains non-volatile configuration information that defines the key parameters of the DIMM.The SPD Hub enables the system to discover what type of memory is present, its capacity, and what the timings are. That data is shared over an I3C-based system management bus. Previous DDR standards used I2C. “The SPD Hub also functions as an I3C bi directional redriver,” says Elbe, “So it sort of hides the loads on the DIMM from the system, allowing it to run faster.” The SPD Hub integrates its own high-accuracy temperature sensor within it. That enables the system to check what the temperature is in that area of the DIMM.The other newly announced chip is the Temperature Sensor (TS5110). This device is likewise defined by JEDEC for the DDR5 standard. It is designed to meet or exceed all JEDEC DDR5 Temperature Sensor operational requirements (per JEDEC spec JESD302-1.01), says Elbe.The Temperature Sensor is a standalone I3C sensor device. These devices can be placed on other spatially different places on the DIMM, says Elbe. Using two of those sensors (as shown in the diagram above), plus the SPD Hub, you can get up to three different measurements on the DIMM.According to Elbe, a data center server’s processor can use the temperature sensor data in many ways. It can use it to regulate fan speed and noise—this also helps reliability based on the temperature. It can change the refresh rate of the DRAM, so you don't have to worry about any refresh errors, or you can save power. And, as a last resort, the CPU can decide to throttle the bandwidth until the temperature goes down, says Elbe.Product briefs for both the SPD Hub (SPD5118) and Temperature Sensor (TS5110) are available for download.DDR5: Built for a New Era of ComputingJust like its predecessor DDR standards, DDR5 had to be crafted to be well aligned with not just current-day processor and memory technology trends but also those of the future. Such care is vital to enable DDR5 to last for decades, like its predecessors.

It will be doing so for billions more years. Yet, we have only just begun tapping into that abundant, renewable source of energy at affordable cost.Solar absorbers are a material used to convert this energy into heat or electricity. Maria Chan, a scientist in the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, has developed a machine learning method for screening many thousands of compounds as solar absorbers. Her co-author on this project was Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi, a former Argonne postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Purdue University.\"According to a recent DOE study, by 2035, solar energy could power 40% of the nation's electricity,\" said Chan. \"And it could help with decarbonizing the grid and provide many new jobs.\"Chan and Mannodi-Kanakkithodi are betting that machine learning will play a vital role in realizing that lofty goal. A form of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning uses a combination of large data sets and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn. It learns from training with sample data and past experience to make ever better predictions.In the days of Thomas Edison, scientists discovered new materials by the laborious process of trial and error with many different candidates until one works. Over the last several decades, they have also relied on labor-intensive calculations requiring as long as a thousand hours to predict a material's properties. Now, they can shortcut both discovery processes by calling upon machine learning.At present, the primary absorber in solar cells is either silicon or cadmium telluride. Such cells are now commonplace. But they remain fairly expensive and energy intensive to manufacture.The team used their machine learning method to assess the solar energy properties of a class of material called halide perovskites. Over the past decade, many researchers have been studying perovskites because of their remarkable efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity. They also offer the prospect of much lower cost and energy input for material preparation and cell building.\"Unlike silicon or cadmium telluride, the possible variations of halides combined with perovskites are essentially unlimited,\" said Chan. \"There is thus an urgent need to develop a method that can narrow the promising candidates to a manageable number. To that end, machine learning is a perfect tool.\"The team trained their method with data for a few hundred halide perovskite compositions, then applied it to over 18,000 compositions as a test case. The method evaluated these compositions for key properties such as stability, ability to absorb sunlight, structure that does not break easily due to defects, and more. The computations agreed well with relevant data in the scientific literature. Also, the findings whittled down the number of compositions worthy of further study to about 400.\"Our list of candidates has compounds that have already been studied, compounds that no one has ever studied, and even compounds that were not among the original 18,000,\" said Chan. \"So we are very excited about that.\"The next step will be to test the predictions using experiments. The ideal scenario would be to use an autonomous discovery laboratory, such as Polybot at Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a DOE Office of Science user facility. Polybot brings together the power of robotics with AI to drive scientific discovery with little or no human intervention.By using autonomous experimentation to synthesize, characterize and test the best of their few hundred prime candidates, Chan and her team anticipate they can also improve the current machine learning method.\"We are truly in a new era of applying AI and high performance computing to materials discovery,\" said Chan. \"Besides solar cells, our design methodology could apply to LEDs and infrared sensors.\"This research is reported in an article in Energy & Environmental Science.", "abstract": "近日，美国阿贡国家实验室研究人员开发出利用人工智能寻找太阳能吸收材料的新技术。传统太阳能吸收器由可将太阳发射能量转化为热能或电能的吸收材料制成，目前，最常使用的吸收材料主要是硅或碲化镉，但这些材料非常昂贵，大幅增加了太阳吸收器的制造成本。为此，研究人员开发出一种利用机器学习方法筛选化合物作为太阳能吸收材料的新技术，研究人员用含有数百种卤化物钙钛矿成分的数据库训练了新开发的机器学习方法，然后将其应用于超过18000种成分的测试，成功评估了这些化合物的关键性能，如稳定性、光吸收能力、低缺陷特性等，而且其计算结果与文献中的相关数据吻合得很好。该研究成果极大地推进了太阳能吸收器的研究。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-sun-artificial-intelligence.html"}, {"title": "瑞士开发出提高钙钛矿太阳能电池抗降解特性的新方法", "keyword": "钙钛矿薄膜 太阳能电池 非活性相", "content_zh": "提高钙钛矿太阳能电池的耐降解性钙钛矿太阳能电池（PSCs）可以用低成本的材料制成，效率高，可以超过传统的硅太阳能电池，具有革新可再生能源的潜力。 然而，目前阻止它们广泛使用的缺点之一是它们缺乏运行稳定性。现在，EPFL和韩国成均馆大学的科学家已经找到了一种提高PSCS稳定性的方法。 研究人员将重点放在钙钛矿薄膜的降解上，这种薄膜可能会因暴露在水分、热和光下而受损。 这项研究由Michael Gr？Tzel(EPFL)和Nam-Gyu Park（成均馆大学）教授小组进行，并发表在《科学》杂志上。科学家们观察了两个特定的晶体面，这是指晶体的平坦表面，其特征是原子的特殊排列。 原子在这些小面上的排列会影响晶体的性质和行为，例如它的稳定性和对水分或热量等外部刺激的响应。研究人员观察了钙钛矿晶体的（100）和（111）小面。 所述（100）面是垂直于晶体c轴的平面，其原子以正方形网格的形式排列成重复图案。 在（111）面中，原子排列成三角形网格。研究发现，在钙钛矿薄膜中最常见的（100）面特别容易降解，因为当暴露在水分中时，它可以迅速转变为不稳定的非活性相。 研究人员还确定了降解的原因，发现这是由于钙钛矿与水分子之间的强键合导致了钙钛矿从稳定相向不稳定相的转变。 他们利用这些信息开发了一种叫做“小面工程”的策略，在这种策略中，他们使用特殊的配体分子来生长更稳定的（111）小面。 这使得钙钛矿薄膜变得非常稳定，既耐潮湿又耐热。这项研究是PSCs发展的重要一步，因为稳定性是PSCs商业化的一个主要障碍。 这些发现提供了一个更好的理解不同的晶体面是如何对薄膜的稳定性做出贡献的； 通过确定最稳定的方面并找到鼓励其增长的方法，有可能提高PSC的总体稳定性，并加速其作为可靠和成本效益高的可再生能源进入市场。 ", "content_en": "Improving perovskite solar cell resistance to degradationPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be made with low-cost materials, are highly efficient, can surpass traditional silicon solar cells, and have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy. However, one of the current drawbacks preventing their widespread use has is their lack of operational stability.Now, scientists at EPFL and Sungkyunkwan University in Korea have found a way to improve the stability of PSCs. The researchers focused on the degradation of perovskite thin films, which can be damaged by exposure to moisture, heat, and light. The study was carried out by the groups of Professors Michael Gr?tzel (EPFL) and Nam-Gyu Park (Sungkyunkwan University), and published in Science.The scientists looked at two specific crystal facets, a term that refers to the crystal's flat surface, characterized by a particular arrangement of atoms. The arrangement of atoms on these facets can affect the properties and behavior of the crystal, such as its stability and its response to external stimuli like moisture or heat.The researchers looked at the (100) and (111) facets of perovskite crystals. The (100) facet is a plane that is perpendicular to a crystal's c-axis with its atoms arranged in a repeating pattern in the form of a square grid. In the (111) facet the atoms are arranged in a triangular grid.The study found that the (100) facet, which is most commonly found in perovskite thin films, is particularly prone to degradation as it can quickly transition to an unstable, inactive phase when exposed to moisture. In contrast, the (111) facet was found to much more stable and resistant to degradation.The researchers also identified the cause of the degradation and found that it was due to a strong bond between the perovskite and water molecules, which caused the transition from the stable to unstable phase. They used this information to develop a strategy called \"facet engineering,\" in which they used special ligand molecules to grow the more stable (111) facet. This resulted in perovskite films that were exceptionally stable and resistant to both moisture and heat.The study represents an important step forward in the development of PSCs, as stability is a major hurdle to their commercialization. The findings provide a better understanding of how the different crystal facets contribute to the stability of the films; by identifying the most stable facets and finding ways to encourage their growth, it may be possible to improve the overall stability of PSCs and accelerate their entry into the market as a reliable and cost-effective source of renewable energy.", "abstract": "近日，瑞士开发出提高钙钛矿太阳能电池抗降解特性的新方发。在该研究中，科学家对钙钛矿晶体的(100)和(111)两个特定晶面进行了研究，发现原子在这些晶面上的排列方式会影响晶体的性质和行为，比如材料的稳定性以及对外界刺激的反应等。钙钛矿晶体的(100)晶面是一个垂直于晶体c轴的平面，其原子以正方形网格的形式重复排列，而在(111)面中原子排列在三角形网格中。研究人员发现，钙钛矿薄膜中最常见的(100)晶面特别容易降解，因为当暴露在水分中时，它可以迅速转变为不稳定的非活性相。相比之下，(111)晶面更加稳定且抗降解能力更强。研究人员还找到了材料降解的原因，发现由于钙钛矿和水分子间的强键导致了从稳定相到不稳定相的转变。研究人员利用这些信息开发出一种称为“面工程”的新方法，使用特殊配体分子生长更稳定的(111)晶面，使钙钛矿薄膜性质更加稳定，并增加了耐潮湿和耐热性能。该研究极大提高了钙钛矿太阳能电池的稳定性，为钙钛矿太阳能电池的未来应用创造了条件。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-perovskite-solar-cell-resistance-degradation.html"}, {"title": "德国开发出搭载多款传感器的一体化无线平台系统", "keyword": "传感器 一体化无线平台系统 分布式系统", "content_zh": "智能制造、智能物流或智能农业：分布式传感器网络每天都在为我们努力工作。 过去，每个应用程序都需要一个定制的解决方案来运行传感器和处理数据。 Fraunhofer IZM的研究人员现在开发了一种平台，可以轻松地混合和匹配各种用途--在此过程中节省了大量的精力和资源。无线传感器几乎存在于所有电子设备中。 它们就在我们身边：从气象站到室内气候监测，传感器系统被设计成跟踪各种参数。 但是，如果一个单一的平台可以完成它们的所有工作，并监控温度、压力、湿度、距离、光线和几乎任何其他东西呢？这种一体化解决方案意味着不必为每一个单独的应用再次发明轮子，因为对于上述许多使用场合，都有一个通用的、成本效益高的解决方案。对于IZM的弗劳恩霍夫可靠性和微集成研究所的研究人员来说，这项雄心勃勃的任务已经完成了五年： 他们努力的结果是为传感器-执行器平台建立了一个全面的硬件和软件生态系统，使工业使用中的状态监测比以往任何时候都更容易和更快。夫琅和费IZM传感器节点和嵌入式微系统小组成功背后的秘密？ 许多项目和独立的开发成果，例如在柏林数字转型中心与其他弗劳恩霍夫研究所合作，都增加了新的洞察力和能力，慢慢地使该平台成为今天的样子。 是时候回顾一下今天无线传感器平台的演变了。在工作的第一阶段，即2017年和2018年，研究人员专注于开发一个模块化硬件平台，该平台可以覆盖大多数已确定的用例。 在汉诺威工业博览会上，这些功能首次在现场环境中展示，该系统安装在工业机器人上，作为无线状态监测的一部分，在积极操作中跟踪温度和加速度。柏林技术大学的研究助理兼弗劳恩霍夫IZM的合作伙伴萨默尔·阿尔·马加奇（Samer al-Magazachi）最初在他的硕士论文中研究了如何通过使用蓝牙低能耗将位置跟踪功能添加到平台上，此后仍在寻求这一应用领域。 这导致了平台的第二次化身，集成了一个USB充电电池，为平台提供真正的无线使用供电。 额外的传感器被添加来测量例如光强度或气压，并包括实时时钟以获得更精确的数据。弗劳恩霍夫IZM的团队研究了将运动探测器数据与雷达和应力传感器数据合并的机会。 在Productronica 2019上，他们能够在风洞中演示该系统，以展示它如何检测和报告机器或钢棒的变形。正是这样的数据将帮助运营商完善机器维护程序的时间安排，或者在整台机器或生产线需要下线之前及时干预并更换受影响的部件。 除了新的电池系统和USB连接之外，LoRa无线电技术最初是在一篇论文的背景下添加的。LoRa是一种特别节能的标准，可以在很远的距离上传输更小的数据集，如传感器数据。 开发了一个适用于Windows、MacOS和Linux的桌面应用程序，以捕获、可视化并将数据存储在用户友好的GUI中，使控制和检索系统数据变得容易。在其最新的化身Swarmy，演示器已经从概念验证设计演变成一个可以控制移动系统中的马达的成熟的传感器-执行器平台。 该平台的电池现在符合QI标准，用于无线感应充电，几个额外的传感器已经在平台上找到了位置，包括飞行时间跟踪器、光强传感器、测量空气质量的气体传感器、噪声测量麦克风和压力传感器。通过模块化设计和接口选择，甚至可以增加更多的外部传感器，如分析液体的化学传感器。 这使得Swarmy成为其他已建立系统的一个很好的补充。 为了更好地使用，桌面应用程序已经移植到安卓手机或平板电脑上，这些手机或平板电脑可以通过Bluetooth连接到系统。这个蜂群应用程序为用户提供了一个简单的界面，可以收集存储在设备本身或云中的数据，例如，供人工智能进一步分析或立即用于其他应用程序。 这个过程再简单不过了：启动应用程序，选择传感器，然后开始测量。 当Swarmy系统被设置并连接到PC机以检查测试时，包含了用于测试的软件接口，以允许对平台进行自动测试 ", "content_en": "A universe of sensors on an all-in-one wireless platformSmart fabrication, smart logistics, or smart farming: Distributed networks of sensors are working hard for us every single day. In the past, every application needed a custom solution to run the sensors and process the data. Researchers at Fraunhofer IZM have now developed a platform that can be easily mixed and matched for each purpose—saving lots of effort and resources along the way.Wireless sensors are present in almost all electronic devices. They are all around us: From weather stations to indoor climate monitoring, sensor systems are designed to track various parameters. But what if a single platform could do all of their jobs and monitor temperature, pressure, humidity, distance, light, and virtually anything else?This all-in-one solution would mean that the wheel does not have to be invented again for every single application, as there is one universal and cost-efficient solution for many of the afore-mentioned use cases.It has been five years of work on this ambitious mission for the researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM: The result of their efforts is a comprehensive hardware and software ecosystem for a sensor-actuator platform that makes condition monitoring in industrial use easier and faster than ever before.The secret behind the success of the Sensor Nodes & Embedded Microsystems group at Fraunhofer IZM? Many projects and separate developments produced e.g. at the Berlin Center for Digital Transformation in cooperation with other Fraunhofer Institutes each added new insights and capabilities and slowly made the platform what it is today. Time for a look back at the evolution of today's wireless sensor platform.In the first phase of the work, in 2017 and 2018, the researchers focused on developing a modular hardware platform that could cover most of the identified use cases. At Hannover Messe, these capabilities were showcased for the first time in a live setting, with the system fitted to an industrial robot to track temperature and acceleration in active operations as part of wireless condition monitoring.Samer Al-Magazachi, research assistant at the Technical University of Berlin and cooperation partner of Fraunhofer IZM, is still pursuing this field of application after originally investigating in his master's thesis how location tracking capabilities could be added to the platform by using Bluetooth Low Energy. This led to the second incarnation of the platform.A USB-chargeable battery was integrated to power the platform for truly wireless use. Additional sensors were added to measure e.g. light intensity or air pressure, and a real-time clock included for even more precise data capture.The team at Fraunhofer IZM investigated opportunities to merge the motion detector data with radar and stress sensor data. At Productronica 2019, they were able to demonstrate the system in a wind tunnel to show how it could detect and report deformation in a machine or a steel bar.It is data like this that will help operators perfect the timing of their machine maintenance procedures or intervene in good time and replace affected parts before entire machines or production lines need to come offline. Alongside the new battery system and USB connectivity, the LoRa radio technology was added, initially in the context of a dissertation.LoRa is a particularly energy-efficient standard that can transmit smaller data sets, like the sensor data, over vast distances. A desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux was developed to capture, visualize, and store the data in a user-friendly GUI that makes it easy to control and retrieve data from the system.In its most recent incarnation, called Swarmy, the demonstrator has evolved from a proof-of-concept design to a full-blown sensor-actuator platform that can control motors in a mobile system. The platform's batteries now work with the Qi standard for wireless induction charging, and several additional sensors have found a place on the platform, including a time-of-flight tracker, a light intensity sensor, a gas sensor to measure air quality, a noise-measuring microphone, and a pressure sensor.With its modular design and choice of interfaces, even more external sensors could be added, like chemical sensors to analyze liquids. This makes Swarmy a great complement to other established systems. For even better ease of use, the desktop application has been ported to Android phones or tablets, which can connect to the system by Bluetooth.The Swarmy application gives users a simple interface to harvest the data stored either on the device itself or in the cloud e.g. for further analysis by AI or for immediate use in other applications. The process could not be simpler: Launch the app, select a sensor, and start measuring. A software interface for tests was included to allow automatic tests of the platform when a Swarmy system is set up and connected to a PC to check that it is compatible with the target hardware.The sensor-actuator platform allows for a multitude of uses and is a good candidate for distributed systems in many scenarios. Our list includes only a few selected uses out of the many possible applications.The researchers at Fraunhofer IZM have long surpassed their ambitious goals from 2017, but this is little reason for them to stop their work. Their plans for the current funding phase is to make the platform even smarter by integrating swarm robotics capabilities, a prospect that is the subject of Samer Al-Magazachi's doctoral research. The proposed system concept would make connected sensor systems even more robust and reliable, but also more versatile and flexible for different use cases. It would be easier to scale up or down and promise greater security, as it takes away the easy target of a single, central system.", "abstract": "近日，德国弗朗霍夫研究所(Fraunhofer IZM)的研究人员开发出了一款可以搭载多款传感器的一体化无线平台，该平台是一个全面的硬件和软件生态系统，可以让设备进行更高效的数据处理和进行多项目匹配，由此节省出大量的时间和资源成本。该系统的首次使用是在工业机器人上，作为无线状态监测系统的一部分，可用于跟踪机器人在主动操作中的温度和加速度。利用最新版本的 Swarmy-V2系统中，研究人员可通过系统调整角度以捕获准确的传感器数据。该系统还可以为用户提供一个简单界面来收集存储在设备自身或云端的数据。新技术具有非常广泛的用途，可以在很多场景中作为分布式系统的优良候选者。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-universe-sensors-all-in-one-wireless-platform.html"}, {"title": "美国Wolfspeed公司将和ZF公司在德国建造碳化硅器件工厂", "keyword": "Wolfspeed公司 ZF公司 碳化硅 半导体器件 ", "content_zh": "Wolfspeed和ZF将在德国建碳化硅器件工厂德国商报1月21日报道，德国商报1月21日报道称，美国北卡罗来纳州达勒姆的Wolfspeed公司与总部位于德国的ZF Friedrichshafen AG（世界最大的汽车行业供应商之一）作为少数合作伙伴，计划在德国西南部萨尔州萨尔布吕肯附近的恩斯多夫废弃燃煤发电站建设一座价值数十亿欧元的工厂，为电动汽车和其他应用制造碳化硅功率半导体器件。 据报道，在该网站上，还将建设一个研究中心，采埃孚将持有多数股权。此前，2019年11月，沃尔夫斯皮德（当时称为克里）和采埃孚扩大了此前与战略伙伴关系的合作，以制造电动传动系统。作为该地区最大的雇主，采埃孚在附近经营着其最大的工厂，9000名员工在那里制造变速器。 去年11月，它宣布打算将其位于萨尔布吕肯的变速器厂改造成纯电动驱动。 该公司已经在800V逆变器的系列化生产中使用了SiC器件。 据报道，新工厂的选址也是因为它靠近德国南部的汽车原始设备制造商和一级工厂。据报道，生产可能在四年后开始，这取决于关于公共部门补贴的谈判，公共部门补贴通常相当于项目总投资的四分之一。新工厂将比沃尔夫斯皮德在美国最新的碳化硅晶圆厂--其位于纽约马西的200毫米晶圆直径的莫霍克谷晶圆厂--耗资约20亿美元。 ", "content_en": "Wolfspeed and ZF to build SiC device fab in Germany, says HandelsblattOn 21 January, German business newspaper Handelsblatt reported that, together with Germany-based ZF Friedrichshafen AG (one of the world’s largest suppliers to the automotive industry) as a minority partner, Wolfspeed Inc of Durham, NC, USA is planning to build a multi-billion-euro factory on the site of a disused coal-fired power station in Ensdorf near Saarbrücken, in the south-western German state of Saarland, to make silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductor devices for electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications.

The 274nm wavelength corresponds to 4.53eV.The researchers report: “Although UV-C laser diodes have been demonstrated in prior work, CW lasing was not possible without cooling.” Hoped-for deployments of such devices include instrumentation, laser machining, and disinfection. Such applications require substantially increased efficiency and lifetime before commercialization would be possible.The material for the laser diode (Figure 1) was grown pseudomorphically on a 2-inch (0001) Al-polar AlN substrate (Figure 2), using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The waveguide layer included two 4.5nm quantum wells as an active photon-emitting layer. While the n-type used a traditonal silicon-doping strategy to tip the equilibrium to conduction by electron carriers, the bulk of the p-type doping was achieved through distributed polarization doping (DPD), which uses the varying charge polarization of AlGaN with different Al-contents to create hole conduction. Only the GaN cap layer was doped with magnesium (Mg) impurities to achieve p-type conduction. The use of DPD avoids the decreasing effectiveness of Mg as a p-type dopant in high- Al-content AlGaN. X-ray analysis confirmed the pseudomorphic nature of the AlGaN, showing the layers to be fully strained to match the AlN substrate lattice.The material was fabricated into 600μm-long devices. The sides of the laser diode mesa was bevelled at a 15° angle with the width of the top p-electrode of 5μm. The researchers explain the purpose of the bevel: “This angle was sufficiently shallow to effectively suppress dislocation formation that can result from the concentrated shear stress generated at the mesa edge.” This allowed the p- and 2xn-electrodes to be placed nearer to the mesa edge than previously, shortening the current flow path through the n-cladding and thus reducing series resistance. The cleaved end facets were coated to provide more than 90% reflectivity.Pulsed operation (100ns at 0.02% duty cycle) was used to test the characteristics without thermal degradation. The peak wavelength at room temperature was 274nm and the thermal shift between -5°C and 65°C was 32pm/K, under current injection 10% above threshold. The characteristic temperature for the shift in threshold current (T0) was 70K. The horizontal and vertical far-field pattern (FFP) spreads were 6° and 30°, respectively, at 1mW output power. The horizontal pattern showed multiple peaks, presumably from different transverse modes. The multiple transverse modes also result in kinks in the emission power-current behavior, probably due to the stimulated emission hopping between these transverse modes.The team comments: “It is expected that the linearity of L–I characteristics above the threshold current will be improved by reducing the number of allowed transverse modes, for instance, by using a narrower ridge and gain geometry or by eliminating higher-order modes by employing absorbing layers.”One effect of using DPD p-doping, it is thought, was the series resistance being almost constant over the temperature range, unlike devices with Mg-doped cladding. The activation energy of Mg-doping is very high, resulting in large changes (reductions) in resistance of the cladding as the temperature increases.The performance under continuous wave/direct current (CW/DC) operation with no thermal control at room temperature was compared with the pulsed results (Figure 3). The threshold current is 125mA, corresponding to 4.2kA/cm2 density. The CW voltage at threshold was 8.7V.The input power at threshold is estimated to increase the junction temperature by 28K above ambient through self-heating, consistent with the increased threshold current. This suggests that CW lasing requires reduced thermal resistance to heat dissipation and reduced heat generation from the series resistance, along with higher T0. The reduction in series resistance to 8.4Ω, from 12Ω in the team’s previous work, was key to achieving CW lasing at room temperature.The team also thinks that better understanding of the factors impacting T0 could increase it towards the 150K level of commercial indium gallium nitride laser diodes. Such factors could include “broadening of the gain spectrum (decreasing the gain), thermally activated carrier escape, free-carrier absorption, and Auger recombination”.", "abstract": "近日，日本旭化成（AsahiKASEI）公司和名古屋大学共同合作报告了在室温环境实现274纳米波长的氮化铝镓中连续波激光二极管。研究人员表示，虽然深紫外激光二极管已在之前的工作中得到证实，但需在低温环境下才可以产生连续波激光。为此，该团队的研究人员使用金属有机化学气相沉积在2英寸极性氮化铝衬底上生长出激光材料，并被制成600微米长的器件。该研究对半导体激光器在所有波长范围内的实际应用和发展具有里程碑意义。未来，深紫外激光二极管可以应用于包括仪器仪表、激光加工和消毒在内的应用范围。", "link": "https://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2023/jan/asahi-050123.shtml"}, {"title": "韩国推出了针对轻型电动汽车电机控制器和电池管理系统优化的金氧半场效晶体管", "keyword": "轻型电动汽车电机控制器 电池管理系统 金氧半场效晶体管", "content_zh": "用于LEV电机控制器的MOSFET Smagnachip推出了第八代150V MXT MOSFET，为轻型电动汽车(LEV)电机控制器和电池管理系统（BMSs）优化。与上一代相比，这是Magnachip的第八代沟槽MOSFET技术，可将RDS(ON)2降低28%。核心单元和终端的增强设计提供了高品质，同时可以避免总栅极电荷的增加。MDT15N054PTRH采用表面贴装无引线器件(TOLL)封装，以减小产品尺寸和改善散热。快速开关也显著提高了能效， 同时实现高功率密度。 此外，保证工作结温从-55°C到175°C。 ", "content_en": "MOSFET for LEV motor controllersMagnachip has launched its eighth-generation 150V MXT MOSFET optimized for Light Electric Vehicle (LEV) motor controllers and battery management systems (BMSs).This is Magnachip’s eighth-generation trench MOSFET technology to lower RDS(on)2by 28%, as compared to the previous generation.An enhanced design of the core cell and termination, delivers a high figure of merit while an increase in the total gate charge can be avoided.MDT15N054PTRH is available in a surface mount device TO-Leadless (TOLL) package to reduce product size and improve heat dissipation.The energy efficiency is also significantly enhanced by fast switching, while enabling high power density.

Both of these nodes are extensions of existing technologies but offer enhanced performance when compared to their original counterparts.The N3E technology, a 3 nm “enhanced” technology, boasts considerable improvements in speed and power consumption compared to previous technologies. In addition, the freedom to implement the FinFETs in a custom manner regarding feature size allows for optimal tradeoffs to be made regarding speed, area, and efficiency.The N4P technology, a 4nm process, is similarly an extension of the N4 platform. Appended with a “P” to represent performance, the N4P process delivers an 11% performance boost compared to the N5 platform and a 6% boost over the N4 platform. Built for easy migration from 5 nm-based designs, the N4P platform allows designers to boost the performance of their designs near painlessly.Finally, in a bid to stave off the end of Moore’s Law, TSMC has also granted certifications for its 3DFabric process: a technology that aims to move the IC design field from a primarily planar to a volumetric point-of-view. With 3DFabric, interested designers may add another dimension to their projects, allowing for broader integration using TSMC’s silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies, all while maintaining the same occupied area on the destination board.Getting the Right Tool for the JobDespite what some engineers may believe about their ability to design working circuits, it’s often true that we need some sort of automation or simulation to verify complex designs. In order to ensure that EDA tools not only meet designer needs but the needs of the technology process, TSMC has formed the EDA Alliance to work directly with EDA tool providers.The EDA Alliance consists of 16 partners in total, including Cadence, Siemens, Ansys, and Synopsys. Each of these groups offers its own EDA tool compatible with the TSMC processes, ranging from physical verifications to timing and power signoffs.

Depending on the specific application, certain EDA tools may offer improved features or better performance. Despite the high number of offerings for EDA tools, designers can rest assured that, so long as their desired tool is certified, it is guaranteed to work with TSMC’s advanced nodes.Feel Confident in Your Custom DesignsWith the inevitable end of Moore’s Law closer than ever, high-performing advanced nodes and new design methodologies such as 3D integration become more critical than ever.

Flexible and wearable pressure sensors are typically fabricated using petroleum-based polymers. The solid waste generated from using such non-biodegradable plastics is harmful for the environment. To avoid this issue, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have now fabricated pressure sensors that use paper as the medium.A pressure sensor detects physical pressure and converts it into an electrical signal that is displayed in the form of a number indicative of its magnitude. Nowadays, paper-based electronic devices are gaining greater attention owing to their natural biodegradability, excellent flexibility, porous fibrous structure, light weight, and low cost. However, paper-based sensors developed so far have certain disadvantages.\"In any sensor, there is always a trade-off between sensitivity and dynamic range. We want to have high sensitivity. Sensitivity is essentially a measure of the smallest entity (amount of pressure) that we can detect. And we want to sense that quantity over an extensive range,\" says Navakanta Bhat, Professor at the Center for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and corresponding author of the paper published in the ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. His team has proposed a design for the paper sensor that, by virtue of its structure and multilayering, achieves high sensitivity and can detect a broad range of pressures (0–120 kPa) with a response time of 1 millisecond.The sensor is made of plain and corrugated cellulose papers coated with tin-monosulfide (SnS) stacked alternatively to form a multi-layered architecture. SnS is a semiconductor that conducts electricity under specific conditions. \"Paper in itself is an insulator. The major challenge was choosing an appropriate 3D device structure and material to give conductive properties to paper,\" says Neha Sakhuja, a former Ph.D. student at CeNSE and the first author of the paper.When pressure is applied on the sensor's surface, the air gaps between the paper layers decrease, increasing the contact area between these layers. Higher contact area leads to better electrical conductivity. On releasing the pressure, the air gaps increase again, thus decreasing the electrical conduction. This modulation of the electrical conductivity drives the sensing mechanism of the paper sensor.\"Our key contribution is the simplicity of the device. It is like creating paper origami,\" explains Bhat.The sensor shows promise in being developed into a flexible and wearable electronic device, especially in the healthcare sector. For example, the research team mounted it onto a human cheek to investigate the motion involved in chewing, strapped it to an arm to monitor muscle contraction, and around fingers to track their tapping. The team even designed a numeric, foldable keypad constructed using the in-house paper-based pressure sensor to demonstrate the device's usability.\"The future applications of this device are limited only by our imagination,\" says Bhat. \"We would [also] like to work on increasing the stability and durability of these sensors and possibly collaborate with industries to manufacture them in large numbers.\"", "abstract": "近日，印度科学研究所研究人员制造出使用纸张作为介质的压力传感器。该传感器由涂有单硫化锡(SnS)的普通纸和波纹纤维素纸交替堆叠而成，形成多层结构。 SnS是一种能在特定条件下导电的半导体。当对传感器表面施加压力时，纸层之间的气隙减小，增加了这些层之间的接触面积，接触面积越大，其导电性越好。在释放压力时，气隙再次增加，从而降低导电性，正是这种电导率的可控性驱动了纸张传感器的传感机制。这种新型传感器凭借其多层结构，实现了非常高的灵敏度，使它可以检测从0～120kPa的压力，而响应时间仅需1毫秒。该传感器有望在医疗保健领域发展成为一种灵活的可穿戴电子设备，例如它可以安装在人的脸颊上，以研究咀嚼时的运动，或将它绑在手臂上监测肌肉收缩等等。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-09-pressure-paper.html"}, {"title": "美国使用合成蛋白质在室温下产生出量子点", "keyword": "合成蛋白质量子点 氨基酸 蛋白ConK 硫化镉量子点", "content_zh": "化学家利用合成蛋白质在室温下制造量子点美国的研究人员利用合成蛋白质催化的室温生化反应制造出量子点。 这项技术由普林斯顿大学的利亚·斯潘格勒、迈克尔·赫克特和同事开发，可以为工业规模的量子点制造提供更可持续的方法。量子点是半导体材料的纳米晶体，具有介于体材料和单个原子之间的有用量子特性。 随着太阳能电池、LED显示屏和量子技术的应用，量子点的研究成为一个热点。 然而，制造这些微小的半导体结构通常需要高温和有毒溶剂--因此研究人员正在寻找制造更环保的量子点的方法。在这项研究中，该小组研究了如何使用精细调节的生化反应来制造量子点，这些生化反应涉及生物系统中自然不存在的蛋白质。 相反，这种蛋白质是在实验室通过结合天然氨基酸制成的。制造金属安全蛋白被称为构建体K(conk)，它于2016年首次合成。 以前的工作已经表明，CONK允许大肠杆菌在有毒浓度的铜中生存。 尽管促进细菌生存的化学机制还不完全清楚，但科学家怀疑这涉及催化过程，导致金属原子与分子结合--使原子毒性降低。 在自然界中，类似的过程也是通过在某些类型的细菌中发现的天然蛋白质来实现的，这些蛋白质可以生活在高浓度的金属中。量子点通常由硫化镉等化合物半导体制成，硫化镉包括有毒金属镉。 由此，Hecht和同事预测CONK可以用于硫化镉量子点的合成。 研究小组发现，康克能够催化氨基酸半胱氨酸的分解，产生包括硫化氢在内的副产品。 这种化合物然后可以与镉反应生成硫化镉纳米晶体。与天然蛋白质相比，Hecht的团队发现，它的新方法有两个关键优势，这与使用CONK生成的纳米晶体生长缓慢有关。 一个优点是，硫化镉纳米晶大多具有相同的晶体结构，而不是两种不同晶体结构的混合物。 第二个是纳米晶体稳定在大约3纳米的大小，尽管形状有点不规则。“我们制造的量子点质量还不高，但可以通过调整合成来改善，”斯潘格勒说。 “我们可以通过工程蛋白质以不同的方式影响量子点的形成来实现更好的质量。”未来，他们希望这项技术能够在室温下工业化生产稳定、高质量的量子点--确保快速增长的量子点产业有一个更可持续的未来。这项研究发表在《美国国家科学院院刊》上。 ", "content_en": "Chemists use synthetic protein to produce quantum dots at room temperatureResearchers in the US have created quantum dots using room-temperature biochemical reactions that are catalysed by an synthetic protein. Developed by Leah Spangler, Michael Hecht and colleagues at Princeton University, the technique could lead to more sustainable methods for manufacturing quantum dots on industrial scales.Quantum dots are nanocrystals of semiconductor materials that have useful quantum properties that fall between those of bulk materials and individual atoms. With exciting applications including solar cells, LED displays and quantum technologies, research into quantum dots is a hot topic. However, the manufacture of these tiny semiconductor structures often requires both high temperatures and toxic solvents – so researchers are on the look-out for ways of making quantum dots that are more environmentally friendly.In the study, the team investigated how quantum dots could be made using finely tuned biochemical reactions that involve a protein that does not exist naturally in biological systems. Instead, the protein was made in the lab by combining naturally-occurring amino acids.Making metals safeThat protein is called Construct K (ConK) and it was first synthesized in 2016. Previous work has shown that ConK allows E Coli bacteria to survive toxic concentrations of copper. Although the chemical mechanisms that boost bacterial survival are not fully understood, scientists suspect that it involves catalysis processes that cause metal atoms to bind to molecules – rendering the atoms less toxic. In nature, a similar process is achieved by natural proteins found in some types of bacteria that can live in high concentrations of metals.Quantum dots are often made from compound semiconductors such as cadmium sulphide – which includes the toxic metal cadmium. As a result, Hecht and colleagues predicted that ConK could be used in the synthesis of cadmium sulphide quantum dots. The team found that ConK was able to catalyse the breakdown of the amino acid cysteine, creating by-products including hydrogen sulphide. This compound can then react with cadmium to create the cadmium sulphide nanocrystals.When compared to natural proteins, Hecht’s team found that its new approach has two key advantages that are related to the slower growth of the nanocrystals when created using ConK. One advantage is that the cadmium sulphide nanocrystals are created mostly with the same crystal structure, rather than with a mixture of two different crystal structures. The second is that the nanocrystals stabilize at sizes of roughly 3 nm, albeit in slightly irregular shapes.“The quantum dots we’re making aren’t great quality yet, but that can be improved by tuning the synthesis,” says Spangler. “We can achieve better quality by engineering the protein to influence quantum dot formation in different ways.”In the future, they hope this technique could lead to the industrial-scale manufacture of stable, high-quality quantum dots at room temperature – ensuring a more sustainable future for the rapidly-growing quantum dot industry.The research is described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "abstract": "近日，美国的研究人员利用合成蛋白质催化的室温生化反应创造了量子点。量子点是半导体材料的纳米晶体，其有用的量子特性介于大块材料和单个原子之间。该团队在实验中研究了如何使用微调的生化反应来制造量子点，这些生化反应涉及的蛋白质并非生物系统中天然不存在的，而是在实验室中通过结合天然存在的氨基酸制成的。这种蛋白质被称为Construct K (ConK)。研究人员认为，蛋白ConK不仅可用于硫化镉量子点的合成，还能够催化氨基酸半胱氨酸的分解，产生包括硫化氢在内的副产品。然后，该化合物可以与镉反应生成硫化镉纳米晶体。不过，研究人员也指出，最新方法研制出的量子点质量还不高，但可通过调整合成方式提高质量。未来，研究人员希望该项技术能够在室温下实现工业规模生产稳定、高质量的量子点。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/chemists-use-synthetic-protein-to-produce-quantum-dots-at-room-temperature/"}, {"title": "加拿大在一维量子伊辛模型中模拟出了量子相变", "keyword": "一维量子伊辛模型 量子相变 相干退火 量子叠加", "content_zh": "在可编程的2000量子比特伊辛链量子计算机中相干模拟量子相变具有在几项复杂任务上优于经典计算机的潜力，但在充分发挥潜力之前，还需要克服许多挑战。 与此同时，物理学家和计算机科学家一直试图现实地估计量子计算技术在不久的将来将表现出的能力。量子模拟--使用可编程模拟设备实现量子系统--被证明对确定量子计算机的近期潜力特别有价值。 使用量子模拟可以研究的一种方法是量子退火，这是一种基于工程量子波动的优化过程。D-Wave Systems和加拿大、美国和日本各研究所的研究人员最近在一个可编程的2000量子比特的一维量子伊辛模型中模拟了量子相变。 他们的研究结果发表在《自然·物理》杂志上，可能会为未来的量子优化和模拟工作提供信息。“相干退火一直是我们想展示的东西，”开展这项研究的研究人员之一安德鲁·金（Andrew D.King）告诉Phys.org。 “一个原因是，它允许我们将我们的可编程量子系统的行为与理想的薛定谔动力学进行比较，提供了量子性的有力证据和这种量子性的基准。一维链非常适合于此，因为它有一个众所周知的封闭形式的解决方案，这意味着我们可以经典地解决它，而不必彻底模拟量子动力学--一般来说，这是一项经典的棘手任务。”一维伊辛链的量子模拟以前已经由其他研究团队完成过，包括哈佛大学的一个小组。 然而，金和他的同事进行的模拟是第一次使用基于退火的量子计算机进行的。 此外，研究人员能够实现比过去证明的更大、更强关联的状态。“我们实验中的关键变量是退火时间，这是D-Wave处理器从其初始量子叠加状态到计算的经典端点所需的时间，”金解释说。 “通常，系统上有500纳秒的速度限制，以允许控制电路的公差。然而，在这项工作中，我们比这快100倍。”由于他们的系统达到了更高的速度，金和他的同事不得不应用更严格的硬件要求，并使用新的软件方法。 这最终使他们能够完美地同步系统中的数千个量子比特。研究人员使用D-Wave Systems创建的高度可编程处理器进行模拟。 为了更可靠地测试其有效性，他们选择模拟一个极其简单且很好理解的量子相变，“我们在实验和没有环境影响的理想量子模型之间看到的极好的一致性是量子退火领域的新发展，”金说。 “它不仅向我们展示了这个系统显然是量子的，而且我们可以将更复杂的系统编程到量子退火器中，并期望它遵循薛定谔方程的真正量子动力学，这通常无法经典地模拟。”总的来说，该团队发现他们的模拟与量子理论的预测一致。 在未来，他们的工作将为不同量子相变的研究打开新的令人兴奋的可能性。 在他们接下来的工作中，King和他的同事们希望使用可编程的D-Wave处理器来模拟更奇异的量子相变，这是用经典计算机无法模拟的。“大多数人希望使用量子退火来进行量子模拟，我们在这里已经做了量子模拟，或者用于优化，”King补充说。 “我们在这项工作中研究的教科书量子相变只是间接适用于优化，所以将这两个领域联系在一起很重要。我们已经知道量子退火可以非常快地解决优化问题。我们的下一个工作将是利用相干退火研究这一成功，详细解释量子临界动力学在量子退火优化中的作用。” ", "content_en": "The coherent simulation of a quantum phase transition in a programmable 2000 qubit Ising chainQuantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers on several complex tasks, yet many challenges will need to be overcome before they reach their full potential. In the meantime, physicists and computer scientists have been trying to realistically estimate the capabilities that quantum computing technologies will exhibit in the near future.Quantum simulations—realizations of quantum systems manifested using programmable simulation devices—have proved particularly valuable for determining the near-term potential of quantum computers. One approach that can be investigated using quantum simulations is quantum annealing, an optimization process based on engineered quantum fluctuations.Researchers at D-Wave Systems and various institutes in Canada, the U.S. and Japan have recently simulated a quantum phase transition in a programmable 2,000 qubit 1D quantum Ising model. Their results, presented in a paper published in Nature Physics, could inform future quantum optimization and simulation efforts.\"Coherent annealing has been something we've wanted to showcase for a long time,\" Andrew D. King, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"One reason is that it allows us to compare the behavior of our programmable quantum system with ideal Schr?dinger dynamics, providing both strong evidence of quantum-ness and a benchmark of this quantum-ness. The 1D chain is perfect for this because it has a well-known closed-form solution, which means that we can solve it classically without exhaustively simulating the quantum dynamics—a classically intractable task in general.\"The quantum simulation of the 1D Ising chain has been done before by other research teams, including a group at Harvard University. However, the simulation carried out by King and his colleagues is the first to be conducted using an annealing-based quantum computer. In addition, the researchers were able to realize larger and more strongly correlated states than those demonstrated in the past.\"The key variable here in our experiment is the annealing time, which is the time the D-Wave processor takes to go from its initial quantum superposition state to the classical endpoint of the computation,\" King explained. \"Normally a speed limit of 500 nanoseconds is placed on the system, to allow tolerances on the control circuitry. In this work, however, we went 100 times faster than this.\"Due to the higher speeds reached by their system, King and his colleagues had to apply more stringent hardware requirements and use new software methods. This ultimately allowed them to perfectly synchronize the thousands of qubits in their system.The researchers performed their simulations using a highly programmable processor created at D-Wave Systems. To test its effectiveness more reliably, they chose to simulate an extremely simple and well understood quantum phase transition.\"The excellent agreement we see between the experiments and the ideal quantum model with no environmental effects is a new development in the field of quantum annealing,\" King said. \"It shows us not only that the system is manifestly quantum, but that we can program more complex systems into the quantum annealer and expect it to follow the true quantum dynamics of the Schr?dinger equation, which in general cannot be simulated classically.\"Overall, the team found that their simulations were aligned with predictions of quantum theory. In the future, their work could open new and exciting possibilities for the study of different quantum phase transitions. In their next works, King and his colleagues would like to use programmable D-Wave processors to simulate more exotic quantum phase transitions, which cannot be simulated using classical computers.\"Most people want to use quantum annealing either for quantum simulation, which we have done here, or for optimization,\" King added. \"The textbook quantum phase transition that we studied in this work is only indirectly applicable to optimization, so it's important to tie these two areas together. We already know that quantum annealers can solve optimization problems very quickly. Our next job will be to study this success using coherent annealing, to explain in detail the role of quantum critical dynamics in quantum annealing optimization.\"", "abstract": "近日，加拿大D-Wave Systems量子计算公司通过与多个国家研究团队的合作，在可编程的2000量子比特一维量子伊辛（Ising）模型中模拟出量子相变。研究主要基于退火的量子计算机进行。其中，相干退火可以为研究人员提供强有力的量子性证据和量子性基准。退火时间是其中的关键变量，即D-Wave处理器从其初始量子叠加状态到计算的经典端点所需的时间。实验中，研究人员使用D-Wave Systems公司制造的高度可编程处理器进行了模拟。模拟从顺磁量子叠加态开始，并以不同的速度穿过量子相变。随着系统响应时间的增长，“扭结”在向上或向下旋转的相反域之间形成。这些扭结的密度和间距显示出量子临界动力学的特征。实验结果表明，该模拟与量子理论的预测一致。未来，研究人员计划利用可编程D-Wave处理器模拟经典计算机无法模拟的奇特量子相变，为研究不同的量子相变探索更多可能性。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-10-coherent-simulation-quantum-phase-transition.html"}, {"title": "德国研发出一种基于相异质结结构的新型太阳能电池", "keyword": "相异质结结构 太阳能电池 碘化铯铅 钙钛矿 ", "content_zh": "相异质结太阳能电池是第一种基于同种吸光材料不同晶相之间异质结的新型太阳能电池，其最大功率转换率为20.1%，且长时间稳定。 这一概念是由德国德累斯顿大学(TUD)的研究人员开发的，可以应用于由其他所谓的多态材料系统制成的电池，以及其他类型的光电器件，如发光二极管和光电探测器。现代太阳能电池通常包含异质结--一种具有不同光电性质的两个组件在界面上相遇的结构。 这些元件的性质通常通过使用不同的材料或通过掺杂相同的材料来调节，从而使结的一边有过量的电子（n掺杂），而另一边有过量的正电荷空穴（p掺杂）。由Yana Vaynzof领导的两种碘化铯铅多形体研究人员现在开发了一种新型的异质结太阳能电池，它使用单一材料的两种多形体或相：碘化铯铅。 这种材料是钙钛矿，在吸收太阳光谱波长的光方面效率很高，其伽马相和β相的光电性质是不同的。 通过将伽马钙钛矿置于β钙钛矿之上，研究人员成功地制造了一种比基于单相钙钛矿的电池效率高得多的太阳能电池。根据Vaynzof和他的同事在《自然能源》上的报告，伽马钙钛矿的顶层通过钝化底部β相层表面的缺陷来提高太阳能电池的性能。 这些缺陷通常捕获光激活电荷载流子（电子和空穴），阻止它们传播到光伏器件的对面并产生电流。Vaynzof补充说，相位异质结还在其他方面提高了电池的性能。 她解释说：“相异质结结构中的光吸收与每一个单相相比都有所增强，两相能级之间的对齐导致太阳能电池具有有利的能量景观，以驱动电荷载流子分离。”“光电的一个全新概念”TUD团队通过分别使用溶液处理和热蒸发技术沉积底部β相和顶部γ相来制造太阳能电池。 这两种技术只需要适度的温度，将它们结合在一起就能在两相之间产生一个尖锐的界面。 相异质结在很长一段时间内也是稳定的。“考虑到相异质结太阳能电池对光伏来说是一个全新的概念，我们预见这样的概念也可能应用于其他多态材料系统”Vaynzof告诉《物理世界》。 “这种概念也有可能应用于其他类型的光电子器件，如发光二极管和光电探测器。”研究人员现在正在探索其他钙钛矿成分的不同相异质结配置。 他们还在探索替代的光伏器件架构。 Vaynzof说：“重要的是，我们的目标是仅使用热蒸发作为沉积方法，以实现多层结构的制造，而不需要在溶液处理中使用溶剂所带来的限制。” 由于热蒸发是一种高度可扩展的、与工业相关的方法，这将促进相异质结在工业应用中的未来集成。“ ", "content_en": "Phase heterojunction solar cell is a firstA new type of solar cell based on heterojunctions between different crystalline phases of the same light-absorbing material boasts a maximum power conversion of 20.1% and is stable for long periods of time. The concept, developed by researchers at the Technische Universit?t Dresden (TUD) in Germany, could be applied to cells made from other so-called polymorphic material systems, as well as to other types of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.Modern solar cells often contain a heterojunction – a structure in which two components with different optoelectronic properties meet at an interface. The properties of these components are usually tuned by using different materials or by doping the same material so that one side of the junction has an excess of electrons (n-doped) while the other has an excess of positively-charged holes (p-doped).Two polymorphs of caesium lead iodideResearchers led by Yana Vaynzof have now developed a new type of heterojunction solar cell that uses two polymorphs, or phases, of a single material: caesium lead iodide. This material is a perovskite and highly efficient at absorbing light at wavelengths in the Sun’s spectrum, and the optoelectronic properties of its gamma and beta phases are different. By placing the gamma-perovskite atop the beta-perovskite, the researchers succeeded in fabricating a solar cell that is much more efficient than cells based on single-phase perovskites.According to Vaynzof and colleagues, who report their work in Nature Energy, the top layer of gamma-perovskite improves the performance of the solar cells by passivating defects at the surface of the bottom beta-phase layer. These defects usually trap photoactivated charge carriers (electrons and holes), preventing them from propagating to the opposite side of the photovoltaic device and producing electric current.The phase heterojunction also increases the cell’s performance in other ways, Vaynzof adds. “Light absorption in the phase heterojunction structure is enhanced as compared to each of the single phases, and the alignment between the energy levels of the two phases results in a beneficial energetic landscape with the solar cell to drive the charge carriers to be separated,” she explains.‘An entirely new concept for photovoltaics’The TUD team made its solar cell by depositing the bottom beta-phase and top gamma-phase using techniques called solution processing and thermal evaporation, respectively. Both techniques require only moderate temperatures and combining them produces a sharp interface between the two phases. The phase heterojunction is also stable over long time periods.“Considering that phase heterojunction solar cells are an entirely new concept for photovoltaics, we foresee that such a concept may also be applied to other polymorphic materials systems” Vaynzof tells Physics World. “It is also possible that such a concept could be applied to other types of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.”The researchers are now exploring different phase heterojunction configurations for other perovskite compositions. They are also exploring alternative photovoltaic device architectures. “Importantly, we aim to use only thermal evaporation as the deposition method to enable the fabrication of multi-layered structures without the limitations that arise from the use of solvents in solution processing,” Vaynzof says. “Since thermal evaporation is a highly scalable, industrially-relevant method, this will facilitate the future integration of phase heterojunctions in industrial applications.”", "abstract": "近日，由德国德累斯顿工业大学领导的研究团队研发出一种新型相异质结太阳能电池，最大功率转换效率高达20.1%，且性能稳定。现代太阳能电池通常包含异质结，这是一种具有不同光电特性的两种成分在界面处相遇的结构。这些元件的特性通常通过使用不同的材料或通过掺杂相同的材料来调节，使得结的一侧具有过量的电子（n型掺杂），而另一侧具有过量的带正电荷的空穴（p型掺杂）。在这项新的研究中，该团队研发出一种新型相异质结太阳能电池，它使用单一材料的两种多晶型物或相：碘化铯铅。这种材料是一种钙钛矿，它在吸收太阳光谱波长的光方面非常有效，其γ和β相的光电特性是不同的。通过将γ-钙钛矿置于β-钙钛矿之上，该团队成功制造了一种太阳能电池，这种电池的效率远高于基于单相钙钛矿的电池高。该团队表示，γ-钙钛矿顶层可以通过钝化底部β相层表面的缺陷来提高太阳能电池的性能。此外，与每个单相相比，相异质结结构的光吸收能力有所增强，有助于相异质结提高新型太阳能电池的性能。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/phase-heterojunction-solar-cell-is-a-first/"}, {"title": "Samco公司推出新型等离子体增强ALD系统", "keyword": "Samco公司 等离子体 原子层沉积 等离子体放电", "content_zh": "SAMCO推出等离子增强型ALD SystemSAMCO是一家半导体及相关工业和学术设施的蚀刻、沉积和表面处理加工设备制造商，推出新的等离子增强型原子层沉积(PEALD)系统“AD-800LP”。 等离子体增强型ALD系统“AD-800LP”是一个多用途的研发系统，除了具有传统的热ALD能力外，还配备了独特的ICP等离子体源“龙卷风ICP”。该系统的主要目标是用于下一代碳化硅(SiC)和氮化镓(GaN)材料功率器件的栅氧化膜沉积，这将在碳中和中发挥重要作用。 AD-800LP可以通过Tornado ICP沉积各种薄膜，如氧化物或氮化物薄膜，这是SAMCO的专有等离子体技术，不同于远程等离子体。 Tornado ICP在ALD沉积过程中即使在高压范围内也能实现稳定的等离子体放电。“我们还在考虑一种集群ALD系统，可以连接多个反应室进行生产，”SAMCO总裁兼首席运营官Tsukasa Kawabe说。 “AD-800LP的推出将极大地提高我们在世界ALD设备市场的存在。”Tsukasa补充道。作为一家全球中型公司，Samco不仅在日本，而且在美国、欧洲、台湾、韩国、中国、东南亚、印度和其他国家，成功地为电子器件领域交付了大量干法蚀刻系统和等离子体增强CVD系统，主要用于碳化硅、氮化镓和砷化镓等化合物半导体。新的纳米薄膜和材料研究中心于2022年2月开业，进行独特薄膜沉积的研究和开发，包括ALD系统。 SAMCO将继续利用我们的“薄膜技术”开发独特的产品，并扩大全球销售。 ", "content_en": "Samco Unveils Plasma Enhanced ALD SystemSamco, a manufacturer of etching, deposition and surface treatment processing equipment for the semiconductor and related industries and academic facilities, launches the new Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) system, \"AD-800LP\".

Their findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, could act as the foundation for engineering more advanced computers that can quantify uncertainty while interpreting complex data.Classical computers have gotten us this far, but there are some problems that they cannot address efficiently. Scientists have been working on addressing this by engineering computers that can utilize the laws of quantum physics to recognize patterns in complex problems. But these so-called quantum computers are still in their early stages of development and are extremely sensitive to their surroundings, requiring extremely low temperatures to function.Now, scientists are looking at something different: a concept called probabilistic computing. This type of computer, which could function at room temperature, would be able to infer potential answers from complex input. A simplistic example of this type of problem would be to infer information about a person by looking at their purchasing behavior. Instead of the computer providing a single, discrete result, it picks out patterns and delivers a good guess of what the result might be.There could be several ways to build such a computer, but some scientists are investigating the use of devices called magnetic tunnel junctions. These are made from two layers of magnetic metal separated by an ultrathin insulator. When these nanomagnetic devices are thermally activated under an electric current and magnetic field, electrons tunnel through the insulating layer. Depending on their spin, they can cause changes, or fluctuations, within the magnets. These fluctuations, called p-bits, which are the alternative to the on/off or 0/1 bits we have all heard about in classical computers, could form the basis of probabilistic computing. But to engineer probabilistic computers, scientists need to be able to describe the physics that happens within magnetic tunnel junctions.This is precisely what Shun Kanai, professor at Tohoku University's Research Institute of Electrical Communication, and his colleagues have achieved.\"We have experimentally clarified the 'switching exponent' that governs fluctuation under the perturbations caused by magnetic field and spin-transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions,\" says Kanai. \"This gives us the mathematical foundation to implement magnetic tunnel junctions into the p-bit in order to sophisticatedly design probabilistic computers.

Exploring and expanding rapid charge-discharge technology and extended battery life are critical challenges in their development. A few factors, such as the diffusion of Li ions, characteristics of the electrode-electrolyte interface, and electrode porosity, can help overcome these issues achieve extreme fast charging and ultralong life.In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, which are thin sheet-like structures with a thickness of a few nanometers, have emerged as potential anode materials for Li-ion batteries. These nanosheets possess a high aspect ratio and high density of active sites, which enables fast charging and superior cycling performance. In particular, 2D nanomaterials based on transition-metal diborides (or TMDs) have piqued the interest of researchers. TMDs have been found to have a high rate and long cycling stability for Li ion storage, owing to their honeycomb planes of boron and multivalent transition-metal atoms.Recently, a group of scientists led by Prof. Noriyoshi Matsumi from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) and Prof. Kabeer Jasuja from the Indian Institite of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar set out to further explore the potential of TMDs for energy storage.The team conducted the first experimental study on the storage potential of titanium diboride (TiB2)-based hierarchical nanosheets (THNS) as an anode material for Li-ion batteries.

For any nanomaterial to translate into a tangible technology, scalability is the limiting factor. Our synthesis method only requires stirring and no sophisticated equipment. This is on account of the dissolution and recrystallization behavior exhibited by TiB2, a serendipitous discovery that makes this work a promising bridge from lab to the field,\" explains Prof. Kabeer.Thereafter, the team constructed an anodic Li-ion half-cell using the THNS as active anode material. The team studied the charge-storage characteristics of the THNS-based anodes.The team found that the THNS-based anode showed a high discharge capacity of 380 mAh/g with a current density of just 0.025 A/g.

Additionally, the THNS-based Li-ion anode could sustain very high current rates, in the order of 15 to 20 A/g facilitating ultrafast charging in about 9 to 14 seconds. Under the high current rate, with a capacity retention greater than 80% was observed after 10,000 cycles.The results of this study indicate the suitability of the 2D TiB2 nanosheets as a candidate for fast-charging and long-life Li-ion batteries.

But solar and wind power are inconsistent at producing enough energy for a reliable power grid. Alternatively, lithium-ion batteries can store energy but are a limited resource.\"The advantage of a coal power plant is it's very steady,\" said Nian Liu, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"If the power source fluctuates like it does with clean energy, it makes it more difficult to manage, so how can we use an energy storage device or system to smooth out these fluctuations?\"Flow batteries offer a solution. Electrolytes flow through electrochemical cells from storage tanks in this rechargeable battery. The existing flow battery technologies cost more than $200/kilowatt hour and are too expensive for practical application, but Liu's lab in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (ChBE) developed a more compact flow battery cell configuration that reduces the size of the cell by 75%, and correspondingly reduces the size and cost of the entire flow battery. The work could revolutionize how everything from major commercial buildings to residential homes are powered.The all-Georgia Tech research team published their findings in the paper, \"A Sub-Millimeter Bundled Microtubular Flow Battery Cell With Ultra-high Volumetric Power Density,\" in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Finding the flowFlow batteries get their name from the flow cell where electron exchange happens. Their conventional design, the planar cell, requires bulky flow distributors and gaskets, increasing size and cost but decreasing overall performance. The cell itself is also expensive. To reduce footprint and cost, the researchers focused on improving the flow cell's volumetric power density (W/L-of-cell).They turned to a configuration commonly used in chemical separation—sub-millimeter, bundled microtubular (SBMT) membrane—made of a fiber-shaped filter membrane known as a hollow fiber. This innovation has a space-saving design that can mitigate pressure across the membranes that ions pass through without needing additional support infrastructure.\"We were interested in the effect of the battery separator geometry on the performance of flow batteries,\" said Ryan Lively, a professor in ChBE. \"We were aware of the advantages that hollow fibers imparted on separation membranes and set out to realize those same advantages in the battery field.\"Applying this concept, the researchers developed an SMBT that reduces membrane-to-membrane distance by almost 100 times. The microtubular membrane in the design works as an electrolyte distributor at the same time without the need for large supporting materials. The bundled microtubes create a shorter distance between electrodes and membranes, increasing the volumetric power density. This bundling design is the key discovery for maximizing flow batteries' potential.Powering the batteryTo validate their new battery configuration, the researchers used four different chemistries: vanadium, zinc-bromide, quinone-bromide, and zinc-iodide. Although all chemistries are functional, two were most promising. Vanadium was the most mature chemistry, but also less accessible, and the reduced form of it is unstable in air. They found zinc iodide was the most energy-dense option, making it the most effective for residential units. Zinc-iodide offered many advantages even compared to lithium: It has less of a supply chain issue and also can be turned into zinc oxide and dissolve in acid, making it much easier to recycle.This electrochemical solution for this unique shape of the flow battery proved more powerful than conventional planar cells.\"The superior performance of the SMBT was also demonstrated by finite element analysis,\" said Xing Xie, an assistant professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \"This simulation method will also be applied in our future study for cell performance optimization and scaling up.\"With zinc-iodide chemistry, the battery could run for more than 220 hours, or to > 2,500 cycles at off-peak conditions. It could also potentially reduce the cost from $800 to less than $200 per kilowatt hour by using recycled electrolyte.Building the future of energyThe researchers are already working on commercialization, focusing on developing batteries with different chemistries like vanadium and scaling up their size. Scaling will require coming up with an automated process to manufacture a hollow fiber module, which now is done manually, fiber by fiber. They eventually hope to deploy the battery in Georgia Tech's 1.4-megawatt microgrid in Tech Square, a project that tests microgrid integration into the power grid and offers living laboratory for professors and students.The SBMT cells could also be applied to different energy storage systems like electrolysis and fuel cells. The technology could even be strengthened with advanced materials and different chemistry in various applications.\"This innovation is very application driven,\" Liu said. \"We have the need to reach carbon neutrality by increasing the percentage of renewable energy in our energy generation, and right now, it's less than 15% in the U.S. Our research could change this.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国佐治亚理工学院的研究人员开发出一种更紧凑的液流电池配置，可将电池尺寸减小75%，并相应降低整个液流电池的尺寸和成本。传统液流电池因其复杂的设计,在尺寸和制造成本上都偏高，从而降低了电池的整体性能。为了缓解这种现状，研究人员在专注于提高流通池的体积功率密度下,利用中空纤维赋予分离膜开发出一种束状微管。该结构可将膜间距离缩短近100倍。而设计中的微管膜在需大型支撑材料的情况下充当电解液分配器，由此缩短电极和膜之间的距离，从而增加了体积功率密度。该设计是发现最大化液流电池潜力的关键。为了验证新电池的配置，研究人员使用了钒、溴化锌、溴化醌和碘化锌四种不同的化学物质来进行测试。结果表明，这四种物质中，碘化锌是作为实现电池能量密度提高的最好选择。该研究优化和提高了电池的整体性能，促进电池技术的创新发展，在未来可能会彻底改变供电方式。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-smaller-cheaper-batteries-energy.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出可增加植入式电池寿命的新材料", "keyword": "非活性电池电解质 电荷载体 液态氟化化合物", "content_zh": "新材料可以实现更持久的植入电池在过去的几十年里，电池研究主要集中在可充电锂离子电池上，这种电池用于从电动汽车到便携式电子产品的所有领域，在价格和容量方面都有了显著提高。 但是在此期间，不可充电电池几乎没有什么改善，尽管它们在许多重要用途中发挥了关键作用，如心脏起搏器等植入式医疗设备。现在，麻省理工学院的研究人员提出了一种方法来提高这些不可充电电池或“初级”电池的能量密度。 他们说，在给定的功率或能量容量下，它可以使使用寿命增加50%，或者相应地减少体积和重量，同时还可以提高安全性，成本几乎没有增加或没有增加。这项新发现涉及用一种对能量输送有活性的材料代替传统的无活性电池电解质，它今天发表在《美国国家科学院院刊》杂志上，由麻省理工学院卡瓦诺博士后高海宁、研究生亚历杭德罗·塞维利亚、机械工程副教授贝塔·格兰特（Betar Gallant）发表在一篇论文中。 麻省理工学院和加州理工学院的另外四人。格兰特说，更换起搏器或其他医疗植入物中的电池需要外科手术，所以电池寿命的任何增加都可能对患者的生活质量产生重大影响。 一次电池被用于这些重要的应用，因为它们可以为给定的尺寸和重量提供大约三倍于可充电电池的能量。高说，这种容量的差异使得一次电池“对于不可能充电或不切实际的应用至关重要”。 新材料可在人体温度下工作，适合于医用植入物。 除了可植入设备之外，随着进一步开发，使电池在较冷的温度下有效运行，应用还可以包括装运跟踪设备中的传感器，例如，以确保在整个装运过程中适当保持食品或药品装运的温度和湿度要求。 或者，它们可能被用于远程操作的空中或水下航行器，这些航行器需要长时间准备部署。起搏器电池通常持续5至10年，如果它们需要除颤等高压功能，寿命甚至更短。 然而，对于这样的电池，高说，这项技术被认为是成熟的，“在过去的40年里，基本的电池化学没有任何重大创新。”该团队创新的关键是一种新的电解液--这种材料位于电池的两极--阴极和阳极之间，允许电荷载流子从一边穿过另一边。 使用一种新的液体氟化化合物，研究小组发现他们可以将阴极和电解质的一些功能结合在一种化合物中，称为阴极电解质。 高说，这可以节省典型一次电池的大部分重量。格兰特解释说，虽然除了这种新化合物之外，还有其他材料在理论上可以在高容量电池中扮演类似的阴极电解质角色，但这些材料的固有电压较低，与传统起搏器电池（一种称为CFX的电池）中的其余材料的固有电压不匹配。因为电池的总输出不能超过两种电极材料中较小的一种，额外的容量将因电压不匹配而浪费。 但是有了这种新材料，“我们氟化液体的关键优点之一是它们的电压与CFX的电压非常一致，”格兰特说。在传统的CFX电池中，液体电解质是必不可少的，因为它允许带电粒子从一个电极穿过另一个电极。 但是“这些电解质实际上没有化学活性，所以它们基本上是自重，”高说。 这意味着大约50%的电池关键成分，主要是电解液，是非活性物质。 但她说，在氟化阴极电解质材料的新设计中，自重可以减少到大约20%。格兰特说，与其他类型的拟议化学物质相比，新电池还提供了安全性改进，这些化学物质将使用有毒和腐蚀性阴极电解质材料，而他们的配方没有。 她说，初步测试已经证明了一年多的稳定保质期，这是一次电池的一个重要特征。到目前为止，该团队还没有在实验中实现他们分析预测的能量密度提高50%。 Gallant说，他们已经证明了20%的改进，这本身对一些应用程序来说是一个重要的增益。 细胞本身的设计尚未完全优化，但研究人员可以投射细胞的性能 ", "content_en": "New materials could enable longer-lasting implantable batteriesFor the last few decades, battery research has largely focused on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are used in everything from electric cars to portable electronics and have improved dramatically in terms of affordability and capacity. But nonrechargeable batteries have seen little improvement during that time, despite their crucial role in many important uses such as implantable medical devices like pacemakers.Now, researchers at MIT have come up with a way to improve the energy density of these nonrechargeable, or \"primary,\" batteries. They say it could enable up to a 50% increase in useful lifetime, or a corresponding decrease in size and weight for a given amount of power or energy capacity, while also improving safety, with little or no increase in cost.The new findings, which involve substituting the conventionally inactive battery electrolyte with a material that is active for energy delivery, are reported today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper by MIT Kavanaugh Postdoctoral Fellow Haining Gao, graduate student Alejandro Sevilla, associate professor of mechanical engineering Betar Gallant, and four others at MIT and Caltech.Replacing the battery in a pacemaker or other medical implant requires a surgical procedure, so any increase in the longevity of their batteries could have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life, Gallant says. Primary batteries are used for such essential applications because they can provide about three times as much energy for a given size and weight as rechargeable batteries.That difference in capacity, Gao says, makes primary batteries \"critical for applications where charging is not possible or is impractical.\" The new materials work at human body temperature, so would be suitable for medical implants. In addition to implantable devices, with further development to make the batteries operate efficiently at cooler temperatures, applications could also include sensors in tracking devices for shipments, for example to ensure that temperature and humidity requirements for food or drug shipments are properly maintained throughout the shipping process. Or, they might be used in remotely operated aerial or underwater vehicles that need to remain ready for deployment over long periods.Pacemaker batteries typically last from five to 10 years, and even less if they require high-voltage functions such as defibrillation. Yet for such batteries, Gao says, the technology is considered mature, and \"there haven't been any major innovations in fundamental cell chemistries in the past 40 years.\"The key to the team's innovation is a new kind of electrolyte—the material that lies between the two electrical poles of the battery, the cathode and the anode, and allows charge carriers to pass through from one side to the other. Using a new liquid fluorinated compound, the team found that they could combine some of the functions of the cathode and the electrolyte in one compound, called a catholyte. This allows for saving much of the weight of typical primary batteries, Gao says.While there are other materials besides this new compound that could theoretically function in a similar catholyte role in a high-capacity battery, Gallant explains, those materials have lower inherent voltages that do not match those of the remainder of the material in a conventional pacemaker battery, a type known as CFx.Because the overall output from the battery can't be more than that of the lesser of the two electrode materials, the extra capacity would go to waste because of the voltage mismatch. But with the new material, \"one of the key merits of our fluorinated liquids is that their voltage aligns very well with that of CFx,\" Gallant says.In a conventional CFx battery, the liquid electrolyte is essential because it allows charged particles to pass through from one electrode to the other. But \"those electrolytes are actually chemically inactive, so they're basically dead weight,\" Gao says. This means about 50% of the battery's key components, mainly the electrolyte, is inactive material. But in the new design with the fluorinated catholyte material, the amount of dead weight can be reduced to about 20%, she says.The new cells also provide safety improvements over other kinds of proposed chemistries that would use toxic and corrosive catholyte materials, which their formula does not, Gallant says. And preliminary tests have demonstrated a stable shelf life over more than a year, an important characteristic for primary batteries, she says.So far, the team has not yet experimentally achieved the full 50% improvement in energy density predicted by their analysis. They have demonstrated a 20% improvement, which in itself would be an important gain for some applications, Gallant says. The design of the cell itself has not yet been fully optimized, but the researchers can project the cell performance based on the performance of the active material itself. \"We can see the projected cell-level performance when it's scaled up can reach around 50% higher than the CFx cell,\" she says. Achieving that level experimentally is the team's next goal.Sevilla, a doctoral student in the mechanical engineering department, will be focusing on that work in the coming year. \"I was brought into this project to try to understand some of the limitations of why we haven't been able to attain the full energy density possible,\" he says. \"My role has been trying to fill in the gaps in terms of understanding the underlying reaction.\"One big advantage of the new material, Gao says, is that it can easily be integrated into existing battery manufacturing processes, as a simple substitution of one material for another. Preliminary discussions with manufacturers confirm this potentially easy substitution, Gao says. The basic starting material, used for other purposes, has already been scaled up for production, she says, and its price is comparable to that of the materials currently used in CFx batteries.The cost of batteries using the new material is likely to be comparable to the existing batteries as well, she says. The team has already applied for a patent on the catholyte, and they expect that the medical applications are likely to be the first to be commercialized, perhaps with a full-scale prototype ready for testing in real devices within about a year.Further down the road, other applications could likely take advantage of the new materials as well, such as smart water or gas meters that can be read out remotely, or devices like EZPass transponders, increasing their usable lifetime, the researchers say. Power for drone aircraft or undersea vehicles would require higher power and so may take longer to be developed. Other uses could include batteries for equipment used at remote sites, such as drilling rigs for oil and gas, including devices sent down into the wells to monitor conditions.", "abstract": "近日，美国麻省理工学院研究人员开发出一种提高不可充电或“原电池”能量密度的新方法。该方法在给定功率或能量容量下的电池可以相应的减小尺寸和重量，并且增加50%的寿命，同时还能在不提高成本的情况下提高电池的安全性。此方法是通过使用一种对能量输送具有活性的材料来代替传统的非活性电池电解质。新型材料位于电池的两个电极（阴极和阳极）之间，便于使电荷载体从一侧穿过至另一侧。研究人员发现使用新的液态氟化物，可以节省典型原电池的大部分重量。研究人员表示，新材料中的氟化液体所拥有的电压与氟化石墨（CFx）的电压非常吻合。到目前为止，该团队已通过实验实现了电池能量密度提高20%的改进，下一步的计划是实现50%的提高。该研究有望快速部署到现有电池制造工艺中。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-materials-enable-longer-lasting-implantable-batteries.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出无芯片无线电子皮肤", "keyword": "无线电子皮肤 蓝牙芯片 可穿戴传感器", "content_zh": "工程师们制造了一种无芯片的无线电子“皮肤”可穿戴传感器无处不在，这要归功于无线技术，该技术使一个人的葡萄糖浓度、血压、心率和活动水平可以无缝地从传感器传输到智能手机，以进行进一步分析。今天，大多数无线传感器通过嵌入式蓝牙芯片进行通信，蓝牙芯片本身由小型电池供电。 但是对于下一代传感器来说，这些传统的芯片和电源可能太大了，下一代传感器正在采取更小、更薄、更灵活的形式。现在，麻省理工学院的工程师们设计了一种新型的可穿戴传感器，它可以无线通信，而不需要机载芯片或电池。 他们的设计详细发表在《科学》杂志上，为无芯片无线传感器开辟了一条道路。该团队的传感器设计是一种电子皮肤，或“电子皮肤”--一种柔性半导体薄膜，像电子透明胶带一样贴合皮肤。 传感器的核心是一种超薄、高质量的氮化镓薄膜，这种材料以其压电特性而闻名，这意味着它既能响应机械应变产生电信号，又能响应电脉冲产生机械振动。研究人员发现，他们可以利用氮化镓的双向压电特性，同时将这种材料用于传感和无线通信。在他们的新研究中，该团队生产了氮化镓的纯单晶样本，他们将其与导电层黄金配对，以增强任何传入或传出的电信号。 他们表明，该设备足够灵敏，可以响应人的心跳和汗液中的盐，材料的振动产生的电信号可以被附近的接收器读取。 通过这种方式，该设备能够无线传输传感信息，而不需要芯片或电池。“芯片需要大量的电力，但我们的设备可以让系统变得非常轻，而没有任何耗电的芯片，”该研究的相应作者、机械工程和材料科学与工程副教授、电子研究实验室的首席研究员Jeehwan Kim说。“你可以像绷带一样把它戴在身上，与手机上的无线阅读器配对，你可以无线监测你的脉搏、汗水， 和其他生物信号。“金的合著者包括第一作者、前麻省理工学院博士后Yeongin Kim，他现在是辛辛那提大学的助理教授； 共同对应作者韩国化妆品公司AmorePacific的Jiyeon Han，帮助激励了目前的工作； 麻省理工学院Kim研究组成员； 和弗吉尼亚大学、圣路易斯华盛顿大学以及韩国多个机构的其他合作者。Pure ResonanceJeehwan Kim的团队此前开发了一种名为远程外延的技术，他们利用这种技术从涂有石墨烯的晶圆上快速生长和剥离超薄高质量半导体。 利用这项技术，他们制造并探索了各种柔性、多功能的电子薄膜。在他们的新研究中，工程师们使用同样的技术剥离了超薄的氮化镓单晶薄膜，氮化镓以其纯净、无缺陷的形式是一种高灵敏度的压电材料。该团队试图使用纯氮化镓薄膜作为传感器和声表面波的无线通信器，声表面波本质上是薄膜上的振动。 这些波的模式可以指示一个人的心率，甚至更微妙地指示皮肤上某些化合物的存在，如汗液中的盐。研究人员假设，附着在皮肤上的氮化镓传感器将有自己固有的“共振”振动或频率，压电材料将同时转换成电信号，无线接收器可以记录电信号的频率。 皮肤状况的任何变化，如心率加快，都会影响传感器的机械振动，以及它自动传输给接收器的电信号。“如果脉搏或汗水中的化学物质，甚至紫外线暴露在皮肤上，所有这些活动都会改变氮化镓薄膜上的声表面波模式，”金英金指出。 “我们的薄膜灵敏度很高，可以检测到这些变化。”为了测试他们的想法，研究人员制作了一层纯高质量氮化镓薄膜，并将其与一层金配对，以增强电信号。 他们把金放在重复哑铃的图案中--一种晶格状的结构，赋予通常坚硬的金属一些灵活性。 氮化镓和金，他们认为是电子皮肤的样本，测量 ", "content_en": "Engineers fabricate a chip-free, wireless, electronic 'skin'Wearable sensors are ubiquitous thanks to wireless technology that enables a person's glucose concentrations, blood pressure, heart rate, and activity levels to be transmitted seamlessly from sensor to smartphone for further analysis.Most wireless sensors today communicate via embedded Bluetooth chips that are themselves powered by small batteries. But these conventional chips and power sources will likely be too bulky for next-generation sensors, which are taking on smaller, thinner, more flexible forms.Now MIT engineers have devised a new kind of wearable sensor that communicates wirelessly without requiring onboard chips or batteries. Their design, detailed in the journal Science, opens a path toward chip-free wireless sensors.The team's sensor design is a form of electronic skin, or \"e-skin\"—a flexible, semiconducting film that conforms to the skin like electronic Scotch tape. The heart of the sensor is an ultrathin, high-quality film of gallium nitride, a material that is known for its piezoelectric properties, meaning that it can both produce an electrical signal in response to mechanical strain and mechanically vibrate in response to an electrical impulse.The researchers found they could harness gallium nitride's two-way piezoelectric properties and use the material simultaneously for both sensing and wireless communication.In their new study, the team produced pure, single-crystalline samples of gallium nitride, which they paired with a conducting layer of gold to boost any incoming or outgoing electrical signal. They showed that the device was sensitive enough to vibrate in response to a person's heartbeat, as well as the salt in their sweat, and that the material's vibrations generated an electrical signal that could be read by a nearby receiver. In this way, the device was able to wirelessly transmit sensing information, without the need for a chip or battery.\"Chips require a lot of power, but our device could make a system very light without having any chips that are power-hungry,\" says the study's corresponding author, Jeehwan Kim, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and of materials science and engineering, and a principal investigator in the Research Laboratory of Electronics.\"You could put it on your body like a bandage, and paired with a wireless reader on your cellphone, you could wirelessly monitor your pulse, sweat, and other biological signals.\"Kim's co-authors include first author and former MIT postdoc Yeongin Kim, who is now an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati; co-corresponding author Jiyeon Han of the Korean cosmetics company AMOREPACIFIC, which helped motivate the current work; members of the Kim Research Group at MIT; and other collaborators at the University of Virginia, Washington University in St. Louis, and multiple institutions across South Korea.Pure resonanceJeehwan Kim's group previously developed a technique, called remote epitaxy, that they have employed to quickly grow and peel away ultrathin, high-quality semiconductors from wafers coated with graphene. Using this technique, they have fabricated and explored various flexible, multifunctional electronic films.In their new study, the engineers used the same technique to peel away ultrathin single-crystalline films of gallium nitride, which in its pure, defect-free form is a highly sensitive piezoelectric material.The team looked to use a pure film of gallium nitride as both a sensor and a wireless communicator of surface acoustic waves, which are essentially vibrations across the films. The patterns of these waves can indicate a person's heart rate, or even more subtly, the presence of certain compounds on the skin, such as salt in sweat.The researchers hypothesized that a gallium nitride-based sensor, adhered to the skin, would have its own inherent, \"resonant\" vibration or frequency that the piezoelectric material would simultaneously convert into an electrical signal, the frequency of which a wireless receiver could register. Any change to the skin's conditions, such as from an accelerated heart rate, would affect the sensor's mechanical vibrations, and the electrical signal that it automatically transmits to the receiver.\"If there is any change in the pulse, or chemicals in sweat, or even ultraviolet exposure to skin, all of this activity can change the pattern of surface acoustic waves on the gallium nitride film,\" notes Yeongin Kim. \"And the sensitivity of our film is so high that it can detect these changes.\"Wave transmissionTo test their idea, the researchers produced a thin film of pure, high-quality gallium nitride and paired it with a layer of gold to boost the electrical signal. They deposited the gold in the pattern of repeating dumbbells—a lattice-like configuration that imparted some flexibility to the normally rigid metal. The gallium nitride and gold, which they consider to be a sample of electronic skin, measures just 250 nanometers thick—about 100 times thinner than the width of a human hair.They placed the new e-skin on volunteers' wrists and necks, and used a simple antenna, held nearby, to wirelessly register the device's frequency without physically contacting the sensor itself. The device was able to sense and wirelessly transmit changes in the surface acoustic waves of the gallium nitride on volunteers' skin related to their heart rate.The team also paired the device with a thin ion-sensing membrane—a material that selectively attracts a target ion, and in this case, sodium. With this enhancement, the device could sense and wirelessly transmit changing sodium levels as a volunteer held onto a heat pad and began to sweat.The researchers see their results as a first step toward chip-free wireless sensors, and they envision that the current device could be paired with other selective membranes to monitor other vital biomarkers.\"We showed sodium sensing, but if you change the sensing membrane, you could detect any target biomarker, such as glucose, or cortisol related to stress levels,\" says co-author and MIT postdoc Jun Min Suh. \"It's quite a versatile platform.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国麻省理工学院研究人员开发出一种无芯片的无线电子皮肤。现有的大多数可穿戴传感器通过嵌入式蓝牙芯片进行通信，这些芯片往往需要电池来为其供电，这些传统的芯片和电源对于下一代传感器来说尺寸太大。为此，研究人员设计出一种新型可穿戴传感器，不需要内置芯片和电池就能进行无线通信。这种传感器是一种由柔性半导体薄膜制成的电子皮肤，其核心是一层超薄的高质量氮化镓薄膜，这种材料的压电特性非常好，这意味着它既可以响应机械应变产生电信号，又可以响应电脉冲产生的机械振动。正是氮化镓的这种双向压电特性使得电子皮肤能够实现无线通信。该研究成果为实现未来无线电子可穿戴设备小型化提供了新的技术路径。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-fabricate-chip-free-wireless-electronic-skin.html"}, {"title": "韩国利用红外光将高水平电力无线传输30米距离", "keyword": "红外光 电力传输系统 分布式激光充电 米级距离", "content_zh": "研究人员使用红外光无线传输功率超过30米，走进机场或杂货店，你的智能手机就会自动开始充电。 这有一天可能会成为现实，这要归功于一种新的无线激光充电系统，该系统克服了以前阻碍开发安全方便的即时充电系统的一些挑战。 韩国世宗大学的研究小组组长金勇·哈（Jinyong Ha）表示：“无线供电的能力可以消除我们手机或平板电脑的电源线。” “它还可以为各种传感器供电，如物联网设备中的传感器和用于监控制造厂过程的传感器。”在《光学快报》中，研究人员描述了他们的新系统，该系统使用红外光来安全传输高水平的电力。 实验室测试表明，它可以在长达30米的距离上传输400兆瓦的光功率。 这种功率足以为传感器充电，随着进一步的发展，它可以增加到为移动设备充电所需的水平。 然而，很难安全地在米级距离上发送足够的电力。 为了克服这一挑战，研究人员优化了一种名为分布式激光充电的方法，该方法最近在这一应用中获得了更多的关注，因为它提供了安全的高功率照明，光损失更少。哈说：“虽然大多数其他方法要求接收设备处于特殊的充电支架中或静止，但只要发射机和接收机在彼此的视线内，分布式激光充电就可以自动对准，而无需跟踪过程。” “如果一个物体或人挡住了视线，它还会自动切换到安全的低功率传输模式。”往远处走，分布式激光充电有点像传统的激光器，但激光腔的光学部件不是集成在一个设备中，而是分成发射机和接收机。 当发射器和接收器在视线内时，在空气或自由空间上，它们之间形成一个激光腔，允许系统传输基于光的功率。 如果障碍物切断了发射机-接收机的视线，系统会自动切换到电力安全模式，实现空中无危险的电力传输。在新系统中，研究人员使用了中心波长为1550纳米的掺铒光纤放大器光功率源。 这个波长范围在光谱中最安全的区域，在使用的功率下对人眼或皮肤没有危险。 另一个关键组件是波分复用滤波器，该滤波器创建了一个窄带光束，其光功率在自由空间传播的安全限制内。哈说：“在接收器单元中，我们集成了一个球形球透镜反向反射器，以促进360度发射器-接收器对齐，这将功率传输效率最大化。” 我们通过实验观察到，该系统的整体性能取决于球透镜的折射率，折射率为2.003是最有效的。 为了演示该系统，研究人员在发射机和接收机之间设置了30米的间隔。 发射机由掺铒光纤放大器光源构成，接收机单元包括一个反向反射器、一个将光信号转换为电能的光伏电池和一个在供电时发光的发光二极管。 实验结果表明，单通道无线光功率传输系统可以在30米的距离内提供400 mW的光功率，通道线宽为1 nm。 光伏将其转换为85兆瓦的电力。 研究人员还表明，当视线被人手打断时，系统会自动转移到安全的电力传输模式。 在这种模式下，发射器产生了令人难以置信的低强度光，对人没有任何风险。“使用激光充电系统来取代工厂的电源线可以节省维护和更换成本，”哈说。 “在恶劣的环境中，这可能特别有用，因为电气连接可能会引起干扰或构成火灾危险。”现在他们已经演示了该系统，研究人员正在努力使其更加实用。 例如，光伏电池的效率可以提高，以更好地将光转换为电力。 他们还计划开发一种使用该系统同时向多个接收器充电的方法。 ", "content_en": "Researchers use infrared light to wirelessly transmit power over 30 metersImagine walking into an airport or grocery store and your smartphone automatically starts charging. This could be a reality one day, thanks to a new wireless laser charging system that overcomes some of the challenges that have hindered previous attempts to develop safe and convenient on-the-go charging systems. \"The ability to power devices wirelessly could eliminate the need to carry around power cables for our phones or tablets,\" said research team leader Jinyong Ha from Sejong University in South Korea. \"It could also power various sensors such as those in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors used for monitoring processes in manufacturing plants.\"In Optics Express, the researchers describe their new system, which uses infrared light to safely transfer high levels of power. Laboratory tests showed that it could transfer 400 mW light power over distances of up to 30 meters. This power is sufficient for charging sensors, and with further development, it could be increased to levels necessary to charge mobile devices.Several techniques have been studied for long-range wireless power transfer. However, it has been difficult to safely send enough power over meter-level distances. To overcome this challenge, the researchers optimized a method called distributed laser charging, which has recently gained more attention for this application because it provides safe high-power illumination with less light loss.\"While most other approaches require the receiving device to be in a special charging cradle or to be stationary, distributed laser charging enables self-alignment without tracking processes as long as the transmitter and receiver are in the line of sight of each other,\" said Ha. \"It also automatically shifts to a safe low power delivery mode if an object or a person blocks the line of sight.\"Going the distanceDistributed laser charging works somewhat like a traditional laser but instead of the optical components of the laser cavity being integrated into one device, they are separated into a transmitter and receiver. When the transmitter and receiver are within a line of sight, a laser cavity is formed between them over the air—or free space—which allows the system to deliver light-based power. If an obstacle cuts the transmitter-receiver line of sight, the system automatically switches to a power-safe mode, achieving hazard-free power delivery in the air.In the new system, the researchers used an erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical power source with a central wavelength of 1550 nm. This wavelength range is in the safest region of the spectrum and poses no danger to human eyes or skin at the power used. Another key component was a wavelength division multiplexing filter that created a narrowband beam with optical power within the safety limits for free space propagation.\"In the receiver unit, we incorporated a spherical ball lens retroreflector to facilitate 360-degree transmitter-receiver alignment, which maximized the power transfer efficiency,\" said Ha. \"We experimentally observed that the system's overall performance depended on the refractive index of the ball lens, with a 2.003 refractive index being the most effective.\" Laboratory testingTo demonstrate the system, the researchers set up a 30-meter separation between a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter was made of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical source, and the receiver unit included a retroreflector, a photovoltaic cell that converts the optical signal to electrical power and an LED that illuminates when power is being delivered. This receiver, which is about 10 by 10 millimeters, could easily be integrated into devices and sensors.The experimental results showed that a single-channel wireless optical power transfer system could provide an optical power of 400 mW with a channel linewidth of 1 nm over a distance of 30 meters. The photovoltaic converted this to an electrical power of 85 mW. The researchers also showed that the system automatically shifted to a safe power transfer mode when the line of sight was interrupted by a human hand. In this mode, the transmitter produced an incredibly low intensity light that did not pose any risk to people.\"Using the laser charging system to replace power cords in factories could save on maintenance and replacement costs,\" said Ha. \"This could be particularly useful in harsh environments where electrical connections can cause interference or pose a fire hazard.\"Now that they have demonstrated the system, the researchers are working to make it more practical. For example, the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell could be increased to better convert light into electrical power. They also plan to develop a way to use the system to charge multiple receivers simultaneously.", "abstract": "近日，由韩国世宗大学领导的研究团队开发出一个新系统，可以使用红外光安全地将高水平电力无线传输30米距离。这种远程光学无线电力传输系统可实现向固定和移动接收器的实时电力传输。科学家已研究了几种用于长距离无线电力传输的技术。然而，很难安全地将足够的电力输送到米级距离。为克服这一挑战，研究人员优化了一种称为分布式激光充电的方法，它提供了安全的高功率照明且光损失更少。实验室测试表明，该系统可以在30米的距离内传输400兆瓦的电能。这种电力足以为传感器充电，随着进一步的发展，有望增加到为移动设备充电所需水平。该激光充电系统有望取代工厂电源线，以节省维护和更换成本，将推动新型远程无线电力传输技术的发展和应用。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-infrared-wirelessly-transmit-power-meters.html"}, {"title": "美国利用等离子光学设计研发紧凑型高功率激光器", "keyword": "拍瓦激光器 衍射光栅 啁啾脉冲 损伤阈值 等离子体", "content_zh": "美国利弗莫尔国家实验室(LLNL)的研究人员设计了一种紧凑的多拍瓦激光器，该激光器使用等离子体透射光栅来克服传统固态光栅的功率限制。 这种设计能够制造出比现有相同尺寸的激光器功率高1000倍的超快激光器。 啁啾脉冲放大(CPA)是一种对高能激光脉冲进行拉伸、放大和压缩以避免损坏光学元件的技术，利用衍射光栅实现啁啾脉冲放大(CPA)。 CPA于2018年获得诺贝尔物理学奖，是国家点火装置先进射线照相能力的核心，也是NIF的前身NOVA激光器，世界上第一台Petawatt激光器。前LLNL博士后马修·爱德华兹（Matthew Edwards）表示，等离子体光栅的损伤阈值比传统反射光栅高几个数量级，“允许我们为相同尺寸的光栅提供更多的功率”，他是8月9日在线发表的一篇物理评论应用论文的合著者，该论文描述了新设计。 爱德华兹与激光-等离子体相互作用小组组长皮埃尔·米歇尔（Pierre Michel）一起参与了这篇论文。爱德华兹说：“用于强激光的玻璃聚焦光学系统必须很大，以避免损坏。” “激光能量被分散开来，以保持局部强度低。例如，因为等离子体比一块玻璃更能抵抗光学损伤，我们可以想象建造一台激光器，它产生的功率是当前系统的数百倍或数千倍，而不使系统变得更大。”LLNL在开发高能激光系统方面有着50年的经验，也是世界上最大衍射光栅设计和制造的长期领导者，例如20世纪90年代用于在新星激光器上产生500焦耳Petawat脉冲的金光栅。 然而，下一代多petawatt和exawatt(1000 petawatt）激光器还需要更大的光栅，以克服传统固体光学对最大注量（能量密度）的限制（参见“用于超高功率激光器的全息等离子体透镜”）。爱德华兹指出，由离子和自由电子混合而成的等离子体光学“非常适合于相对高重复率、高平均功率的激光器”。 例如，新的设计可以使一个激光系统在捷克共和国的ELI波束线上发射类似于L3 HAPLS（高重复率高级PetaWatt激光系统）大小的激光系统，但峰值功率为100倍。由LLNL设计和建造，并于2017年交付给ELI波束线，HAPLS被设计成在30飞秒（千分之一秒）的脉冲持续时间内产生30焦耳的能量，相当于一PetaWatt， 以10赫兹（每秒10个脉冲）的速度进行。“如果你想象一下，在相同的重复频率下，试图以100倍的峰值功率建造HAPLs，这是最合适的系统，”现在是斯坦福大学机械工程助理教授的爱德华兹说。“光栅可以在非常高的重复频率下重新制造，所以我们认为这种设计有可能实现10赫兹的操作。 然而，它不适合高平均功率的连续波激光器。“虽然等离子体光学已经成功地用于等离子体镜，研究人员说，但它们在高功率下用于脉冲压缩的用途受到了创造足够均匀的大等离子体的困难和非线性等离子体波动力学的复杂性的限制。”爱德华兹说：“事实证明，很难让等离子体做你想让它们做的事情。” “很难让它们足够均匀，也很难让温度和密度变化足够小，等等。”“我们的目标是设计一种不均匀性对整个系统来说是一个尽可能小的问题--设计应该非常容忍你使用的等离子体中的缺陷。”基于使用细胞中粒子(PIC)代码Epoch的模拟，研究人员说，“我们预计这种方法能够提供其他基于等离子体的压缩机制无法达到的稳定性，并可能证明在实践中更可行。” 新的设计“只需要气体作为初始介质，对等离子体条件的变化具有鲁棒性，并将等离子体体积降至最低，以实现足够的均匀性。”“通过使用可实现的等离子体参数，避免固体密度等离子体和固体光学，这种方法为下一代高功率激光器提供了一条可行的道路。” ", "content_en": "Researchers design compact high-power laser using plasma opticsLawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers have designed a compact multi-petawatt laser that uses plasma transmission gratings to overcome the power limitations of conventional solid-state optical gratings. The design could enable construction of an ultrafast laser up to 1,000 times more powerful than existing lasers of the same size. Petawatt (quadrillion-watt) lasers rely on diffraction gratings for chirped-pulse amplification (CPA), a technique for stretching, amplifying and then compressing a high-energy laser pulse to avoid damaging optical components. CPA, which won a Nobel Prize in physics in 2018, is at the heart of the National Ignition Facility's Advanced Radiographic Capability as well as NIF's predecessor, the Nova Laser, the world's first petawatt laser.With a damage threshold several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reflection gratings, plasma gratings \"allow us to deliver a lot more power for the same size grating,\" said former LLNL postdoc Matthew Edwards, co-author of a Physical Review Applied paper describing the new design published online on Aug. 9. Edwards was joined on the paper by Laser-Plasma Interactions Group Leader Pierre Michel.\"Glass focusing optics for powerful lasers must be large to avoid damage,\" Edwards said. \"The laser energy is spread out to keep local intensity low. Because the plasma resists optical damage better than a piece of glass, for example, we can imagine building a laser that produces hundreds or thousands of times as much power as a current system without making that system bigger.\"LLNL, with 50 years of experience in developing high-energy laser systems, also has been a longtime leader in the design and fabrication of the world's largest diffraction gratings, such as the gold gratings used to produce 500-joule petawatt pulses on the Nova laser in the 1990s. Still larger gratings, however, would be required for next-generation multi-petawatt and exawatt (1,000-petawatt) lasers to overcome the limits on maximum fluence (energy density) imposed by conventional solid optics (see \"Holographic Plasma Lenses for Ultra-High-Power Lasers\").Edwards noted that optics made of plasma, a mixture of ions and free electrons, are \"well suited to a relatively high-repetition-rate, high-average-power laser.\" The new design could, for example, make it possible to field a laser system similar in size to the L3 HAPLS (High-Repetition-Rate Advanced Petawatt Laser System) at ELI Beamlines in the Czech Republic, but with 100 times the peak power.Designed and constructed by LLNL and delivered to ELI Beamlines in 2017, HAPLS was designed to produce 30 joules of energy in a 30-femtosecond (quadrillionth of a second) pulse duration, which is equal to a petawatt, and do so at 10 Hertz (10 pulses per second).\"If you imagine trying to build HAPLS with 100 times the peak power at the same repetition rate, that is the sort of system where this would be most suitable,\" said Edwards, now an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University.\"The grating can be remade at a very high repetition rate, so we think that 10 Hertz operation is possible with this type of design. However, it would not be suitable for a high-average-power continuous-wave laser.\"While plasma optics have been used successfully in plasma mirrors, the researchers said, their use for pulse compression at high power has been limited by the difficulty of creating a sufficiently uniform large plasma and the complexity of nonlinear plasma wave dynamics.\"It has proven difficult to get plasmas to do what you want them to do,\" Edwards said. \"It's difficult to make them sufficiently homogenous, to get the temperature and density variations to be small enough, and so on.\"\"We're aiming for a design where that kind of inhomogeneity is as small a problem as possible for the overall system—the design should be very tolerant to imperfections in the plasma that you use.\"Based on simulations using the particle-in-cell (PIC) code EPOCH, the researchers said, \"we expect that this approach is capable of providing a degree of stability not accessible with other plasma-based compression mechanisms, and may prove more feasible to build in practice.\" The new design \"needs only gas as the initial medium, is robust to variations in plasma conditions, and minimizes the plasma volume to make sufficient uniformity practical.\"\"By using achievable plasma parameters and avoiding solid-density plasma and solid-state optics, this approach offers a feasible path toward the next generation of high-power laser.\"", "abstract": "近日，由美国劳伦斯利弗莫尔国家实验室（LLNL）领导的研究团队研发出一种紧凑型多拍瓦激光器，该设计可用于制造超快激光器，其功率可达到现有同等大小激光器的1000倍。拍瓦（千兆瓦）激光器依靠衍射光栅进行啁啾脉冲放大（CPA），这是一种通过对高能激光脉冲进行拉伸、放大、压缩，避免光学元件损坏的技术。由于损伤阈值较传统反射光栅高几个数量级，因此研究团队利用等离子光栅，以提供更大功率。在新研究中，研究人员克服了传统固体光学器件的最大通量（能量密度）限制，并使用等离子体传输光栅克服传统固态光栅的功率限制，设计出全新高功率激光器。研究人员表示，由等离子体（离子和自由电子的混合物）制成的光学器件非常适合高重复率、高平均功率的激光器。该研究为开发下一代高功率激光器提供了一条可行的技术路径，推动了激光电子学领域的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-compact-high-power-laser-plasma-optics.html"}, {"title": "美国宣布增加对中国芯片技术出口的限制", "keyword": "芯片技术 超级计算机 先进半导体技术", "content_zh": "美国商务部（Doc）以国家安全为由，增加了对中国出口芯片和相关生产工具的限制。 宣布后，美国参议院多数党领袖查克·舒默（Chuck Schumer）指出，他正在敦促进一步限制。美国国防部工业和安全局(BIS)今天宣布了控制中国购买或制造先进芯片和开发超级计算机能力的规则。根据国际清算银行的声明，中国利用这项技术生产包括大规模杀伤性武器在内的军事系统，以及提高其军队的有效性和侵犯人权。“我们正在尽一切努力保护我们的国家安全，防止具有军事用途的敏感技术被中华人民共和国军事、情报部门获取， 和安全服务，“负责工业和安全的商务部副部长艾伦·埃斯特韦斯在国际清算银行的声明中说。 “威胁环境总是在变化，我们今天正在更新我们的政策，以确保我们在继续与盟友和合作伙伴进行外联和协调的同时，应对中国提出的挑战。”DOC最近几个月宣布了一系列限制向中国出口芯片技术的措施，包括限制英伟达和AMD的GPU销售。 今天的声明是技术战的最新一击，这场战争始于美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）执政期间，在现任美国总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）领导下加剧。国际清算银行警告说，它仍然可以通过将中国公司转移到其所谓的实体名单上来增加更多限制，有效阻止他们购买半导体和生产技术的能力。“如果东道国政府阻止国际清算银行及时进行最终用途检查，我们将在未经核实的名单上增加当事方，如果拖延足够严重，实体名单， 以防止任何可能损害我们国家安全利益的美国技术被转移的风险，“根据国际清算银行的公告。拜登政府今天将31家中国公司和机构列入”未经核实的名单“，包括内存芯片制造商扬子内存技术公司(YMTC)。舒默在提供给《电子时报》的准备好的讲话中说，他继续”敦促拜登政府迅速采取其他出口管制行动，并将YMTC列入实体名单，以保护美国的技术供应链和美国消费者“。 “对美国先进制造技术转让的这些限制是绝对必要的，但仍有许多工作要做，以阻止中国共产党欺骗和窃取其技术主导地位。”舒默说，在即将出台的《国防授权法案》(NDAA)中，参议院将以几种方式进一步加强美国反对中国旨在破坏美国芯片制造的经济和产业政策的立场。从两年前开始，美国政府将曾经是世界上最大智能手机制造商的华为， 以及实体名单上的近30家其他中国科技公司，阻止他们购买芯片和半导体生产设备。国际清算银行表示，将为向中国芯片晶圆厂出口增加新的许可证要求。 中国实体拥有的晶圆厂许可证将面临“推定拒绝”，跨国公司拥有的晶圆厂许可证将根据具体情况决定。 关键阈值是采用FinFET或栅通(GAA)架构在16纳米或14纳米节点或以下制造的3D芯片； 18纳米半间距或更小的DRAM芯片； 以及128层或更高的NAND闪存芯片。路透社援引匿名消息来源报道，拜登政府将免除韩国SK Hynix和三星对中国现有生产设施的一些新限制。据BIS称，外国政府阻止BIS做出合规决定的行动将影响一家公司通过加入实体名单获得美国技术。DOC表示，它就这些控制咨询了国际合作伙伴。新规定还限制了美国公民支持中国晶圆厂无许可证开发或生产芯片的能力。 ", "content_en": "Commerce Adds Limits on Exports of Chip Tech to ChinaThe U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) added limits on exports of chips and related production tools to China, citing national security concerns.

Unfortunately, patterns of light get distorted when they pass through noisy channels, for instance, stressed optical fiber, aberrated optics, turbid living tissue, and perhaps a very severe example, atmospheric turbulence in air.In all these examples, the distorted pattern can deteriorate to the point that the output pattern looks nothing like the input, negating the benefit. As reported in Advanced Photonics, researchers in South Africa have shown how it is possible to find distortion-free forms of light that come out of a noisy channel exactly the same as they were put in. Using atmospheric turbulence as an example, they showed that these special forms of light, called eigenmodes, can be found for even very complex channels, emerging undistorted, while other forms of structured light would be unrecognizable.Passing light through the atmosphere is crucial in many applications, such as free-space optics, sensing, and energy delivery, but finding how best to do this has proved challenging. Traditionally a trial-and-error approach has been used to find the most robust forms of light in some particular noisy channel, but to date all forms of familiar structured light have shown to be distorted as the medium becomes progressively noisier. The reason is that light can \"see\" the distortion.But is it possible to create light that doesn't see the distortion, passing through as if it wasn't there? To make this advance, the researchers treated the noisy channel as a mathematical operator and asked a simple question: what forms of light would be invariant to this operator? In other words, light waves that are in the natural modes of the channel behave as if they don't see the distortion: the true eigenmodes of the channel.The example tackled was the severe case of distortions due to atmospheric turbulence. The answer to the problem revealed previously unrecognized forms of light (i.e., those not in any well-known structured light family, but nevertheless completely robust to the medium). This fact was confirmed experimentally and theoretically for weak and strong turbulence conditions.According to corresponding author Andrew Forbes, SPIE Fellow and Distinguished Professor at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, \"What is exciting about the work is that it opens up a new approach to studying complex light in complex systems—for instance, in transporting classical and quantum light through optical fiber, underwater channels, living tissue, and other highly aberrated systems.\"He adds, \"Because of the nature of eigenmodes, it doesn't matter how long this medium is, nor how strong the perturbation, so that it should work well even in regimes where traditional corrective procedures, such as adaptive optics, fail.\"Maintaining the integrity of structured light in complex media will pave the way to future work in imaging and communicating through noisy channels, which is particularly relevant when the structured forms of light are fragile quantum states.", "abstract": "近日，南非威特沃特斯兰德大学研发出一种无失真形式的结构光，这些光从嘈杂的通道中出来后，与它们被放入通道前的模式完全相同。现代光学中一个令人兴奋的前景是利用光的模式，即光在多个自由度下的样子，它们通常被称为“结构光”。每一种不同的图案都可以形成一个用于光通信的编码字母表，或可以用于制造业以提高生产力。遗憾的使，当光穿过有噪声的信道时，它们的模式就会扭曲，其中一个非常严重的例子是空气中的大气湍流。在新的研究中，研究人员展示了如何能够找到这种无失真形式的光。以大气湍流为例，研究人员将噪声通道视为一个数学算子，证明了具有本征模特殊形式的光，可以在非常复杂的通道中通过，并保持不失真，而其他形式的结构光则无法被识别。这项工作为研究复杂系统中的复杂光开辟了新的方法，在复杂通道中保持结构光的完整性将为未来通过噪声通道成像和通信等工作的开展奠定基础。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-02-distortion-free.html"}, {"title": "韩国开发出高容量锂金属电池", "keyword": "锂金属电池 纳米颗粒 循环寿命", "content_zh": "高容量锂金属电池提高倍率性能和稳定性韩国电技术研究所下一代电池研究中心（Korea Electrochnology Research Center）的Kim Byung Gon博士领导的研究小组对锂金属电池的研究作为封面论文发表在国际期刊ACS Nano上。目前的锂离子电池是基于插层机制将锂离子进出石墨阳极来产生能量的，而锂金属电池不依赖于这种笨重的石墨，而是使用金属锂本身作为阳极。 由于锂金属显示出比石墨（372毫安时/克）高10倍的理论容量（3860毫安时/克），它越来越受到需要高容量电池的领域的关注，如电动汽车和储能系统。尽管有这一优势，但如果在循环过程中不均匀有效地储存锂，锂可以生长成树枝状，称为锂枝晶，导致电极体积大幅膨胀，这反过来可能缩短电池的循环寿命，并导致内部短路引发火灾和爆炸等安全问题。为了解决这个问题， Keri发展了一维Li约束多孔碳结构，并在空心核中加入少量具有Li亲和力的金纳米粒子。 这里，金通过优先与Li反应来控制Li的生长方向，从而诱导Li在核内沉积。 在现有的空心核壳结构中，一个主要的挑战是在高倍率充电条件下，Li沉积在导电碳壳上，而不是在核内。 因此，Keri团队在外壳上引入了许多纳米尺寸的孔隙，即使在5毫安/平方厘米的大电流测试条件下，也在没有Li枝晶生长的情况下实现了显著提高的库仑效率。 Kim的团队与钟昂大学的Janghyuk Moon教授合作，从理论上验证了这种材料设计的有效性，模拟结果表明，即使在大电流充电条件下，壳层孔减少了Li离子的扩散长度，金纳米粒子提高了Li的亲和力，也保持了Li在结构中的沉积。 此外，所设计的Li主机在4C倍率的高电流密度下（容量保持率为82.5%）显示出超过500次的优良循环性能。 值得注意的是，这项技术符合实用性，因为团队使用了在大规模生产中具有优势的静电纺丝技术进行材料合成。金博士说：“尽管锂金属电池具有高容量的优点，但商业化仍有许多障碍需要克服，主要是稳定性和安全性问题。” Kim博士还说，“我们的研究是无价的，因为我们开发了一种用于快速充电锂金属电池的高库仑效率锂金属储层的大规模生产技术。”KERI研究团队的这项研究作为补充封面论文发表在ACS Nano8月版上。 ", "content_en": "High-capacity Li-metal battery with improved rate-performance and stabilityA study of Li-metal batteries by the research team led by Dr. Byung Gon Kim at Next-Generation Battery Research Center of Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) was published as a cover paper in the international journal ACS Nano.While the current Li-ion batteries generate energy by taking Li-ions in and out of the graphite anode based on the intercalation mechanism, the Li-metal battery does not rely on this bulky and heavy graphite but uses metallic Li itself as the anode. As the Li-metal shows 10 times higher theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh/g) than graphite (372 mAh/g), it has steadily gained much attention from areas that need high-capacity batteries, such as electric vehicles and energy storage systems.Despite this advantage, Li can grow in the shape of a tree branch, called a Li dendrite, if it is not uniformly and effectively stored when cycling process, leading to large volume expansion of the electrode, which in turn may shorten the battery's cycle life and cause safety issue such as fire and explosion triggered by internal short-circuits.To tackle this issue, KERI developed 1D Li-confinable porous carbon structure with a hollow core, and a small number of gold nanoparticles with Li affinity were added to the hollow core. Here, the gold controls the growth direction of Li by preferentially reacting with Li, thereby inducing Li deposition inside the core. In addition, many nano-sized pores are formed in the shell part to improve the Li-ion movement toward the core space.A major challenge observed in the existing hollow core-shell Li host was the Li deposition on the conductive carbon shell, not inside the core, under high-rate charging conditions. Therefore, the KERI team introduced many nano-sized pores to the shell, and achieved significantly improved coulombic efficiency without Li dendrite growth even under a high-current testing condition of 5 mA/cm2.Dr. Kim's team collaborated with Prof. Janghyuk Moon at Chung-Ang University for theoretical validation of the effectiveness of this material's design, and the simulation results showed that the reduced Li ion diffusion length by the shell pores and improved Li affinity by the gold nanoparticles kept Li deposition inside the structure even under high-current charging condition. Moreover, the designed Li host showed excellent cycling performance of over 500 cycles under a high current density of 4C rate (82.5% capacity retention). It is also notable that this technology meets practicality because the team used the electrospinning technique with advantages in mass production for material synthesis.\"Despite the merit of high capacity, the Li-metal batteries have many hurdles to be overcome for commercialization mainly due to stability and safety issues,\" said Dr. Kim.

Instead, they rely on improvements to telescopes and analysis techniques to create higher-resolution images from whatever light they receive, however faint or noisy it may be. Now, a team of scientists has proposed a way of using quantum error correction to combat noise in the starlight captured by telescopes. According to the team, even the simplest error-correction protocols run on near-term quantum devices could offer a significant advantage for astronomical imaging.Imaging resolution is typically limited by diffraction. Quantum sensing techniques can surpass this limit if the imaged object can be manipulated or illuminated, but this is not possible in astronomy. Researchers at Macquarie University in Australia and the National University of Singapore (NUS) have, however, found a workaround: they showed that quantum error correction can protect fragile captured starlight from being degraded by unwanted interactions with its environment.Alice and Bob rewrite the starsThe idea behind the team’s proposed method is that information carried by the starlight could be spread out over a large quantum system in a so-called error-correcting code. Then even if some parts of the system have errors, the correct information can be reconstructed from the rest.To understand how the new technique works, imagine two astronomers, Alice and Bob. Both have telescopes, and if they want to produce a clearer image than is possible from each telescope individually, they can combine the light they collect using a method called optical interferometry. In principle, the further apart their telescopes are, the greater the image resolution they can jointly achieve. However, in practice, noise and transmission losses degrade the quality of Alice’s and Bob’s signals, limiting how far apart their telescopes can be.The Macquarie-NUS team propose that quantum technologies could bypass this restriction by replacing the physical link (typically an optical fibre) between telescope sites with entangled qubits. Qubits are systems that store quantum information, and when entangled, the states of these systems share correlations that are stronger than those allowed in classical systems. When Alice and Bob receive light at their telescopes, a light-matter interaction transfers information from the light to a stable state of their qubits. Then they each apply suitable operations to the qubits that store the starlight information. Since their qubits are entangled, the information becomes stored in a quantum error-correcting code within the larger set of both their qubits.“The resulting state shared by Alice and Bob is now the … equivalent of the starlight that went in,” explains Zixin Huang, the lead author of a paper in Physical Review Letters on the research. Because the overall state of the starlight is shared in a protected form across Alice and Bob’s qubits, it is robust to noise from the environment. By performing specific measurements, Alice and Bob can detect and then correct any errors on their qubits before they retrieve the starlight information, which they then use to construct their image.Super-resolution experiments on the horizonThe researchers showed that this quantum error-correction technique for imaging is helpful even with near-term quantum devices by investigating one of the simplest error-correction protocols. In this protocol, starlight information is stored in sets of three identical qubits. This is known as the repetition code because the protection against errors comes from literally repeating information three times. While larger codes provide better protection, even this small code provided useful protection against the dominant type of error. Furthermore, unlike quantum computing, which requires error rates of much less than 1%, the protocol for imaging can tolerate error rates of up to 50% using just the repetition code. “Super-resolution” imaging beyond the diffraction limit is therefore an unexpected near-term use-case for noisy quantum devices, though technological challenges remain before scientists can implement the different parts of the protocol.Because the researchers’ framework enables quantum error correction techniques to be applied to any imaging task where the experimenter is not able to prepare the object, its applications could extend beyond astronomy. “One potential application that some of us are considering is in magnetometry, where we use quantum error correction to enhance the performance of quantum sensors for magnetic field sensing,” explains Yingkai Ouyang, a senior research fellow at NUS who was involved in the work. “We are also working with experimentalists to implement our previous protocols for super-resolution imaging onto real telescopes.”", "abstract": "近日，澳大利亚麦格理大学和新加坡国立大学合作研究出使用量子纠错校准望远镜系统噪声的方法。该方法可以让量子设备中运行的简单纠错协议为天文成像提供显著优势。研究人员表示，量子纠错可以保护捕获的脆弱星光不会因环境影响而导致退化。该方法的原理是利用纠错码将星光携带的信息传播到大型量子系统中，即使传播过程中系统存在部分错误，也可从系统其余部分重建正确信息。为此，研究人员在进行实验时所使用的量子技术可以通过用纠缠的量子比特替换望远镜站点之间的物理链路来绕过望远镜相聚较远的限制。之后，研究人员通过研究最简单的纠错协议来证明使用量子设备时辅以成像的量子纠错技术可以大幅提升效率。此外，该协议仅使用重复代码就可以规避高达50%的错误率。该研究促进了量子纠错技术在成像领域的应用，成功将量子纠错技术扩展至天文学之外的应用场景，推动了人类对太空的进一步研究。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-error-correction-could-help-astronomers-image-stars/"}, {"title": "瑞士提高染料敏化太阳能电池的能量转换效率", "keyword": "染料敏化太阳能电池 能量转换效率 二氧化钛", "content_zh": "染料敏化太阳能电池实现新的功率转换效率记录介观染料敏化太阳能电池（DSCs）是由Brian O'Regan和Michael Gr？Tzel于20世纪90年代发明的，以后者的名字命名--举世闻名的Gr？Tzel电池。 DSCs通过光敏剂--染料化合物吸收光，并将电子注入氧化物纳米晶体阵列，随后将其作为电流收集。在DSCs中，光敏剂附着（“吸附”）在纳米晶介孔二氧化钛薄膜的表面，该薄膜被氧化还原活性电解质或固体电荷传输材料吸收--整个设计旨在通过将电子从光敏剂移向像设备或存储单元一样的电输出来产生电力。DSCs是透明的，可以以低成本制成多种颜色，已经被用于天窗、温室， 以及玻璃幕墙，比如装饰Swisstech会议中心的玻璃幕墙。 此外，轻质灵活的DSC现已大规模商业销售，用于耳机和电子阅读器等便携式电子设备的供电，以及利用环境光在物联网中的应用。光敏剂和DSC其他组件的最新进展改善了DSC在太阳光和环境光条件下的性能。 但提高DSC效率的关键在于了解和控制染料分子在二氧化钛纳米颗粒膜表面的组装，使其有利于电荷的产生。共敏化是一种化学制备方法，它用两种或两种以上具有互补光吸收的不同染料制备DSC。 共敏化使DSCs的功率转换效率达到了世界纪录值，因为它可以想象地结合可以从整个光谱吸收光的染料。 然而，共敏化在某些情况下也被证明是无效的，因为找到合适的染料对可以获得高的光吸收和功率转换效率需要艰苦的分子设计、合成和筛选。现在，来自EPFL的Gr？Tzel和Anders Hagfeldt小组的科学家开发了一种方法来改进两种新设计的光敏染料分子的包装，以提高DSC的光伏性能。 这些新的光敏剂可以在整个可见光区域定量地收集光。 这项新技术涉及在纳米晶介孔二氧化钛表面预吸附一层异羟肟酸衍生物。 这减缓了两种敏化剂的吸附，使得在二氧化钛表面形成有序且致密的敏化剂层。利用这种方法，该团队首次在标准全球模拟阳光下开发出功率转换效率为15.2%的DSCS，并测试了500小时以上的长期运行稳定性。 通过将有源面积增加到2.8cm2，在较宽的环境光强范围内，功率转换效率在28.4%-30.2%之间，并具有出色的稳定性。这项研究发表在《自然》杂志上。作者写道，“我们的发现为轻松获得高性能DSCs铺平了道路，并为以环境光为能源的低功耗电子器件的电源和电池替代提供了广阔的应用前景。” ", "content_en": "Dye-sensitized solar cells achieve a new power conversion efficiency recordMesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were invented in 1990s by Brian O'Regan and Michael Gr?tzel, taking on the latter's name—the world-famous Gr?tzel cells. DSCs convert light into electricity through photosensitizers—dye compounds that absorb light and inject electrons into an array of oxide nanocrystals which subsequently are collected as electric current.In DSCs, photosensitizers are attached (\"adsorbed\") to the surface of nanocrystalline mesoporous titanium dioxide films that are imbibed with redox active electrolytes or a solid charge-transport material—the entire design aims to generate electric power by moving electrons from the photosensitizer towards an electrical output like a device or a storage unit.DSCs are transparent, can be fabricated in multiple colors for low cost, and are already being used in skylights, greenhouses, as well as glass facades, such as those adorning the SwissTech Convention Center. In addition, lightweight flexible versions of DSCs are now commercially sold on a large scale for electrical powering of portable electronic devices such as earphones and e-readers, as well in the Internet of Things by using ambient light.Recent advancements in photosensitizers and other components of DSCs have improved the performance of DSCs under both solar sunlight and ambient light conditions. But the key to enhance DSC efficiency, lies in understanding and controlling the assembly of dye molecules on the surface of titanium dioxide nanoparticle films that favor the generation of electrical charge.One method is cosensitization, a chemical fabrication approach that produces DSCs with two or more different dyes that have complementary optical absorption. Cosensitization has moved the power-conversion efficiencies of DSCs towards world-record values because it can conceivably combine dyes that can absorb light from across the entire light spectrum. Nonetheless, cosensitization has also proved ineffective in some cases since finding the right pairs of dyes that can achieve high light absorption and power conversion efficiency requires painstaking molecular design, synthesis, and screening.Now, scientists from the groups of Gr?tzel and Anders Hagfeldt at EPFL have developed a way of improving the packing of two newly designed photosensitizer dye molecules to enhance the DSC's photovoltaic performance. Together, the new photosensitizers can harvest light quantitatively across the entire visible domain.

Water splitting involves the breakdown of water in an electrochemical cell to produce hydrogen at the cathode while generating oxygen at the anode under applied voltage. Yet, hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts that perform well in fresh water become less effective in seawater because of abundant ions that can promote unwanted reactions and poison catalysts.Highly corrosive chloride ions present in seawater undergo complex reactions that compete with oxygen evolution and generate harmful compounds, such as hypochlorite. Because hydrogen production hinges on stable and efficient reactions at both electrodes, these ions are a major challenge for seawater splitting.Chemist Huabin Zhang explains that hypochlorite formation can occur because it demands a lower operational voltage to meet industrial needs than the oxygen evolution reaction.One way to tackle this issue is to design selective anode catalysts with lower voltage requirements. A nickel–iridium monolayered anode catalyst showed enhanced performance and stability in seawater thanks to synergistic effects between its metal components.Zhang's team devised an approach that provides high-efficiency and stable hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for seawater splitting. The researchers created tiny cubic reactors, in which the catalyst was encased in a molybdenum sulfide protective shell. The catalyst core consisted of a carbon-supported molybdenum-based redox active compound and featured a zeolite-like ordered nanoporous structure.Using a metal organic framework-based approach, the researchers combined metal complex precursors with the linker imidazole in the presence of surfactant to generate zeolite-like zinc–molybdenum cubes. They mixed the resulting structures with thioacetamide in ethanol under reflux to form a cubic molybdenum oxide phase confined in a thin zinc sulfide shell.Next, they chemically converted the cubic phase into the desired molybdenum sulfide-encapsulated redox active compound at high temperature before selectively etching the zinc sulfide outer layer to yield the nanoreactors.The nanoreactors exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and stability in both fresh water and seawater. \"The remarkable activity and stability are attributed to their unique structure,\" Zhang says.The core displayed numerous active sites that boosted hydrogen production and the shell presented several defects within its layers, especially subnanometer-sized holes that allowed water molecules to permeate and access the internal active sites.Acting as a chainmail, the shell also blocked and prevented salts from depositing on the active sites.The hierarchical architecture of the nanoreactor isolates the electrolysis from side reactions. \"Similar to a smart house, the main reaction occurs in the rooms while side reactions happen in the backyard,\" Zhang says.Their findings are published in Chem Catalysis.The researchers are now designing advanced catalysts with specific configuration to achieve a more sustainable energy conversion during seawater splitting.

Several components, including power splitters, antennas and antenna feeders, have been designed, fabricated and characterized using the selective laser melting (SLM) process.

This makes it suitable for broadband point-to-point data links over long distances, which is a key capability for future 6G architectures.Various transmission experiments conducted by Fraunhofer HHI have already demonstrated the performance of the jointly developed components: In different outdoor scenarios, signals corresponding to the current development specifications of 5G (5G-NR Release 16 of the global mobile communications standardization organization 3GPP) were transmitted at 85 GHz with a bandwidth of 400 MHz.With a clear line-of-sight, data was successfully transmitted over a distance of 600 meters in 64-symbol quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM), ensuring a high bandwidth efficiency of 6 bits/s/Hz. The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the received signal was -24.43 dB, well below the 3GPP limit of -20.92 dB. With line-of-sight obstructed by trees and parked vehicles, 16QAM modulated data could be successfully transmitted over a distance of 150 meters. Even with a completely blocked line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver, it was still possible to transmit and successfully receive four-phase modulated data (Quaternary Phase-Shift Keying, QPSK) with an efficiency of 2 bits/s/Hz. The high signal-to-noise ratio of sometimes more than 20 dB in all scenarios is remarkable, especially considering the frequency range, and is only made possible by the high performance of the developed components.In a second approach, a transmitter module for the frequency range around 140 GHz was developed, combining an output power of more than 100 mW with an extreme bandwidth of 20 GHz. Tests with this module are still pending. Both transmitter modules are ideal components for the development and testing of future 6G systems in the terahertz frequency range.", "abstract": "自动驾驶汽车、远程医疗、自动化工厂、交通、医疗保健和工业中的这些有前途的未来应用将依赖于超出当前第五代移动通信标准(5G)性能范围的信息和通信技术。近日，由德国弗劳恩霍夫应用固体物理研究所领导的研究团队研发出一种基于功率半导体氮化镓（GaN）的E波段第六代移动通信（6G）发射器模块，该模块将适用于70 GHz以上的6G频率范围。在这项新研究中，研究人员利用该模块首次实现在80 GHz（E波段）和140 GHz（D波段）频率范围内的信号发射。作为一种宽带隙半导体材料，GaN可以处理更高的电压，同时实现更低的损耗和更紧凑的元件集成。研究人员表示，该技术有望应用于2030年推出的6G移动通信系统，为未来数字化应用提供高速通信网络，数据速率将超过1 Tbit/s，延迟降至100 ?s。通过技术创新，将使未来移动通信技术向前迈进一大步，新技术赋能的第六代移动通信技术也将进一步加速未来人工智能、虚拟现实和物联网等创新应用领域的发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-09-e-band-transmitter-module-based-gan.html"}, {"title": "韩国利用强离子轰击提高内存性能", "keyword": "强离子 神经形态器件 存储器 人工智能", "content_zh": "利用强离子轰击提高存储器性能最近，研究人员开发了一种新技术，通过强离子轰击过程极大地提高了闪存的性能。 此存储平台可在单一设备中可靠地表达多个数据，使其适用于未来的神经形态计算，并增加存储容量。Postech教授Yoonyoung Chung（电机工程学系及半导体工程学系）及博士。 候选人Seongmin Park（电气工程学系）在与三星电子的联合研究中，开发了一种通过故意产生缺陷来增加数据存储量的闪存。随着人工智能技术的发展，需要开发一种新颖的半导体器件，为具有多级数据的神经网络优化。 为了克服这些问题，研究小组在闪存的数据存储层沉积过程中实施了强等离子体轰击过程，在闪存器件中产生人工缺陷位点。闪存作为神经形态器件已经被开发出来，但与闪存相比，在耐久性、可扩展性和存储容量方面存在局限性，闪存已经被广泛用作各种应用的存储设备。 研究人员证实，在产生的缺陷中可以存储更多的电子，与传统的闪存相比，极大地增加了数据存储量。当电子逐渐填充到产生许多缺陷的数据存储层时，可以显示出具有多级数据的存储器。 本研究开发的多级闪存可以可靠地区分8个数据级别，其研究结果的重要意义在于，它们可以最大限度地降低开发新半导体材料或结构的风险，同时显著地提高闪存的性能和可扩展性，以用于人工智能应用。 当应用于神经形态系统时，与传统设备相比，推断的准确性和可靠性有望得到显著提高。这项研究最近发表在《今日材料纳米》上。 ", "content_en": "Boosting memory performance with strong ion bombardmentRecently, researchers have developed new technology that dramatically improves the performance of flash memory by a strong ion bombardment process.

These are materials through which an electrical current can flow without energy losses, could be very promising for the development of high-performance supercomputers and quantum computers.Researchers at University of California Santa Barbara, Raytheon BBN Technologies, University of Cagliari, Microsoft Research, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology have recently developed a magneto-optic modulator—a device that control the properties of a light beam through a magnetic field. This device, introduced in a paper published in Nature Electronics, could contribute to the implementation of large-scale electronics and computers based on superconductors.\"We are working on a new technology that can speed up high-performance supercomputers and quantum computers based on superconductor technology,\" Paolo Pintus, the researcher who led the study, told TechXplore. \"Superconductors work properly only at low temperatures, generally just above absolute zero (-273.15° Celsius). Because of this, circuits made of these materials must be kept inside a dedicated refrigerator.\"Circuits made of superconductors are typically connected to their external surroundings using metal cables. These cables have a limited communication speed and can transfer heat into a cold circuit.A promising alternative would be to use optical fibers, thin and flexible glass wires that can convey light signals and are currently used to bring internet data over long distances. These fibers offer two main advantages over metal cables: they can transmit 1,000 times more data within the same period of time without transferring heat, since glass is a good thermal insulator.\"As part of our work, we designed and fabricated a device (known as 'optical modulator') that converts information carried by an electrical current in an electromagnet into light,\" Pintus explained. \"This is thanks to a physical mechanism called 'magneto-optic effect.' This light can travel through an optical fiber and carry information out of the cold environment, without altering the functionality of the cold circuit.\"Optical modulators such as the device created by Pintus and his colleagues allow researchers to control the properties of light beams, so that they can transfer information in the form of optical signals. These modulators have numerous potential applications, for instance allowing the transmission of binary (one and zero) codes over long distances.The magneto-optic modulator created by the researchers uses an electrical current to generate a magnetic field. This magnetic field in turn induces a change in the optical properties of a synthetic garnet where light is propagating.\"The mechanism underpinning our modulator is analogous to a guitar player who changes the stiffness of the strings to play a different sound,\" Pintus said. \"In our case, the magnetic field controls the optical density of the medium where the light is traveling, such that when the light can propagate, we get a '1,' and when the light is attenuated, we have a '0.'\"In initial evaluations, the magneto-optic modulator created by Pintus and his colleagues achieved highly promising results. Most notably, it reached a relatively fast modulation speed (a few Gigabits per second) and could operate at temperatures as low as 4 K (-269.15° Celsius).\"This is the key component to enable energy-efficient large data transfer rate from superconducting circuits, operating inside a cryostat at low temperature, and room temperature,\" Pintus said. \"Normally, optical modulators are based on a few electro-optic effects, where an electric field changes the optical property of the material where the light is propagating. The magneto-optic effect that we used, on the other hand, is a dual effect, where a magnetic field changes the optical property of a medium.\"Although the magneto-optic effect is well-known and extensively studied, Pintus and his colleagues were among the few who investigated its potential value for creating modulators. This area had not been explored much before because manufacturing integrated magneto-optic devices and applying fast time-variant magnetic fields can be very challenging. In addition, the magneto-optic effect tends to be associated with significantly slower response times than electro-optic effects.\"Ours is the first proof of concept of a high-speed modulator based on a magneto-optic effect,\" Pintus said. \"With this modulator, we demonstrate a key building block to enable effective communication between cryogenic environment and room-temperature electronics using optical fibers. Compared to previous cryogenic (electro-optic) modulators, our proposed solution has a very simple structure and it is compatible with superconducting circuits, since the input electrical impedance is very small.\"The promising performance and cryogenic nature of the researchers' modulator make it suitable for connecting standard electronics (at room temperature) with cryogenic superconducting and quantum computing architecture. In the future, this recent study could pave the way for new research focusing on magneto-optic materials for optical modulation and on their potential computing applications.\"In our work, we demonstrated a modulation rate of 2 Gigabit-per-second with energy consumption below 4 picojoule-per-bit of transferred information, which could be reduced by 80 times (below 50 femtojoule-per-bit) by optimizing the fabrication process in the same material system,\" Pintus added. \"Although this performance is impressive, we believe there is a lot of room for further improvements. In our next works, we would like to explore other materials to achieve higher modulation rate and lower power consumption. The field of cryogenic magneto-optic material is an unexplored area and it will take more investigation to narrow down the most promising materials.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国加州大学圣巴巴拉分校研究人员开发出一种新型磁光调制器。这种调制器可控制光束特性，能够以光信号形式传递信息。这种磁光调制器主要利用电流产生磁场，在光传播方向上，利用磁场引起合成石榴石光学性质改变。在研究中，研究人员利用磁场控制光传播介质中的光密度，当光传播时，得到逻辑‘1’，而当光衰减时，得到逻辑‘0’。值得注意的是，这种新的调制器的调制速度能够达到几千兆每秒，并可以在低至4 开尔文(-269.15摄氏度)的温度下工作。新调制器具有良好的性能和低温特性，适合将标准电子电路与低温超导和量子计算架构连接起来。未来，这项最新的研究成果有望加速和拓展光调制磁光材料在量子计算领域的应用。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-09-magneto-optic-modulator-next-generation-superconductor-based.html#"}, {"title": "日本扩充Ku波段氮化镓高电子迁移率晶体管产线", "keyword": "氮化镓高电子迁移率晶体管 多载波通信 单载波通信", "content_zh": "三菱扩大Ku频段GaN-HEMT线--三菱电气为该公司的卫星通信地球站GaN HEMT系列增加了两款12.75-13.25GHz（低Ku频段）70W(48.3dBm)GaN HEMT新产品。这两款GaN HEMT产品，一款用于多载波通信，另一款用于单载波通信，即使在低Ku频段也支持更大的数据传输容量和更小的地球站。 这两个产品将于2023年1月15日推出。Ku波段卫星通信系统越来越多地被用于自然灾害期间的紧急通信，以及电视广播公司在没有光纤和/或电缆网络的农村地区的卫星新闻收集(SNG)。 对于卫星通信地面站，目前的主流系统使用14 GHz频段，但在不久的将来，他们预计将使用低Ku(13 GHz）频段和Ka(28 GHz）频段来满足提高数据传输能力的需求。到目前为止，三菱电机已经为多载波和单载波卫星通信地面站提供了七种GaN HEMT。 目前推出的两款新型70W GaN HEMT也将支持低Ku波段的紧急通信和SNG。 ", "content_en": "Mitsubishi expands ku-band GaN-HEMT line-upMitsubishi Electric has added two new 12.75-13.25 GHz (Low-Ku band) 70W (48.3dBm) GaN HEMTss to the company's GaN HEMT lineup for SATCOM earth stations.The two GaN HEMT products, one for multicarrier communications and the other for single-carrier communications, support increased data-transmission capacity and smaller earth stations even in the Low-Ku band.

Instead of replacing red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes side by side in a horizontal patchwork, the team has invented a way to stack the diodes to create vertical, multicolored pixels.Each stacked pixel can generate the full commercial range of colors and measures about 4 microns wide. The microscopic pixels, or \"micro-LEDs,\" can be packed to a density of 5,000 pixels per inch.\"This is the smallest micro-LED pixel, and the highest pixel density reported in the journals,\" says Jeehwan Kim, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. \"We show that vertical pixellation is the way to go for higher-resolution displays in a smaller footprint.\"\"For virtual reality, right now there is a limit to how real they can look,\" adds Jiho Shin, a postdoc in Kim's research group. \"With our vertical micro-LEDs, you could have a completely immersive experience and wouldn't be able to distinguish virtual from reality.\"The team's results are published in the journal Nature. Kim and Shin's co-authors include members of Kim's lab, researchers around MIT, and collaborators from Georgia Tech Europe, Sejong University, and multiple universities in the U.S, France, and Korea.Placing pixelsToday's digital displays are lit through organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)—plastic diodes that emit light in response to an electric current. OLEDs are the leading digital display technology, but the diodes can degrade over time, resulting in permanent burn-in effects on screens. The technology is also reaching a limit to the size the diodes can be shrunk, limiting their sharpness and resolution.For next-generation display technology, researchers are exploring inorganic micro-LEDs—diodes that are one-hundredth the size of conventional LEDs and are made from inorganic, single-crystalline semiconducting materials. Micro-LEDs could perform better, require less energy, and last longer than OLEDs.But micro-LED fabrication requires extreme accuracy, as microscopic pixels of red, green, and blue need to first be grown separately on wafers, then precisely placed on a plate, in exact alignment with each other in order to properly reflect and produce various colors and shades. Achieving such microscopic precision is a difficult task, and entire devices need to be scrapped if pixels are found to be out of place.\"This pick-and-place fabrication is very likely to misalign pixels in a very small scale,\" Kim says. \"If you have a misalignment, you have to throw that material away, otherwise it could ruin a display.\"Color stackThe MIT team has come up with a potentially less wasteful way to fabricate micro-LEDs that doesn't require precise, pixel-by-pixel alignment. The technique is an entirely different, vertical LED approach, in contrast to the conventional, horizontal pixel arrangement.Kim's group specializes in developing techniques to fabricate pure, ultrathin, high-performance membranes, with a view toward engineering smaller, thinner, more flexible and functional electronics. The team previously developed a method to grow and peel away perfect, two-dimensional, single-crystalline material from wafers of silicon and other surfaces—an approach they call 2D material-based layer transfer, or 2DLT.In the current study, the researchers employed this same approach to grow ultrathin membranes of red, green, and blue LEDs. They then peeled the entire LED membranes away from their base wafers, and stacked them together to make a layer cake of red, green, and blue membranes. They could then carve the cake into patterns of tiny, vertical pixels, each as small as 4 microns wide.\"In conventional displays, each R, G, and B pixel is arranged laterally, which limits how small you can create each pixel,\" Shin notes. \"Because we are stacking all three pixels vertically, in theory we could reduce the pixel area by a third.\"As a demonstration, the team fabricated a vertical LED pixel, and showed that by altering the voltage applied to each of the pixel's red, green, and blue membranes, they could produce various colors in a single pixel.\"If you have a higher current to red, and weaker to blue, the pixel would appear pink, and so on,\" Shin says. \"We're able to create all the mixed colors, and our display can cover close to the commercial color space that's available.\"The team plans to improve the operation of the vertical pixels. So far, they have shown they can stimulate an individual structure to produce the full spectrum of colors. They will work toward making an array of many vertical micro-LED pixels.\"You need a system to control 25 million LEDs separately,\" Shin says. \"Here, we've only partially demonstrated that. The active matrix operation is something we'll need to further develop.\"\"For now, we have shown to the community that we can grow, peel, and stack ultrathin LEDs,\" Kim says. \"This is the ultimate solution for small displays like smart watches and virtual reality devices, where you would want highly densified pixels to make lively, vivid images.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国麻省理工学院的研究人员开发了一种新的方法来制造更清晰、无缺陷的显示器。微型LED的制造需要极高的精度，因为红色、绿色和蓝色的显微像素需要首先分别生长在晶片上，然后精确地放置在板上，彼此精确对齐，以便正确地反射和产生各种颜色和色调。达到这样的微观精度是一项艰巨的任务，如果发现像素错位，整个设备都需要报废。因此研究人员开发了一种新方法来制造微型LED，该团队没有在水平拼接中替换红色、绿色和蓝色发光二极管，而是发明了一种堆叠二极管的方法，以创建垂直的多色像素。每个堆叠的像素可以产生全部商业范围的颜色，宽度约为4微米。这种方法不需要精确的逐像素对齐，与传统的水平像素排列相比，该技术是一种完全不同的垂直LED方法。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-stacking-side-enable-fully-immersive.html"}, {"title": "美国研究发现锂离子电池中的缺陷可以增强电池性能", "keyword": "激光 极短脉冲 锂离子电池 缺陷 原子 石墨", "content_zh": "微结构和缺陷工程提高锂离子电池的性能。北卡罗来纳州立大学与美国能源部橡树岭国家实验室的电池测试研究人员合作进行的一项新研究表明，来自大功率激光的极短脉冲会在锂离子电池材料中造成微小缺陷--这些缺陷可以提高电池性能。这项技术被称为纳秒脉冲激光退火，持续时间仅为100纳秒，由现代眼科手术中使用的相同类型的激光产生。 研究人员在石墨上测试了这项技术，石墨是一种广泛用于锂离子电池阳极或正极的材料。 他们对该技术进行了10脉冲和80脉冲的批量测试，并比较了电流容量的差异； 功率是通过电压乘以电流来计算的。锂离子电池广泛应用于便携式电子设备和电动汽车中。 随着进一步的改进，这些电池可能会对交通以及作为风能和太阳能等可再生能源的存储设备产生重大影响。NC州立大学约翰·C·范家族杰出材料科学主席、一篇描述这项工作的论文的相应作者杰伊·纳拉扬说，这项研究显示了一些有趣的结果。 纳拉扬在40多年的工作中率先使用激光来制造和操纵半导体中的缺陷。 这项工作发表在《碳》杂志上。“材料缺陷可能是一个麻烦，但如果你正确地设计它们，你可以使它们成为一个优势，”他说。 “可以说，这项技术为锂离子打开了大门，因此它提高了电流容量。 石墨阳极由表面的台阶和凹槽组成--创造更多的台阶就像为锂离子进出创造更多的门，这是有益的。“这项技术还会产生称为空位的缺陷，这是缺失的原子，这有助于为锂离子提供更多的来来去去的位置，这与电流容量有关。”当使用最佳脉冲数时，电流容量增加了20%，接近10脉冲，而不是80脉冲。然而，研究也表明，好事太多可能是坏事， 因为石墨阳极中太多的缺陷会导致问题。“锂离子有正电荷，所以如果它捕获一个电子，它就会变成锂金属，你不想这样，”纳拉扬说。 “锂金属从石墨阳极上射出细小的线枝晶，会引起火灾。所以你要确保锂离子不会变成金属。”纳拉扬说，制造商应该有能力在生产阳极和阴极时使用纳秒脉冲激光退火，其他电极包含在电池中。“这些大功率激光存在，你可以在一微秒内处理阳极和阴极，”纳拉扬说。 “阴极或阳极是在一张纸上制成的，这使得治疗相对快速和容易。”德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校的纳拉扬和同事最近发表了另一篇论文，在阴极材料上使用了同样的激光技术。 这项研究发表在ACS应用材料和接口上，显示激光处理增强了阴极材料。纳拉扬说：“下一步，我们正试图消除使用更昂贵材料的需求，如电池阴极中的钴，以制造更高功率和更持久的电池。”NC州立大学生物医学工程特聘教授罗杰·纳拉扬（Roger Narayan）与第一作者NC州立大学研究生奈娜·科斯拉（Nayna Khosla）一起在《碳》杂志上合著了这篇论文。 来自橡树岭国家实验室的孙晓光和M.Paranthaman也是该论文的合著者。 ", "content_en": "Microstructure and defect engineering improves performance of lithium-ion batteriesA new North Carolina State University study, performed in collaboration with battery testing researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, shows that extremely short pulses from a high-powered laser can cause tiny defects in lithium-ion battery materials—defects that can enhance battery performance.The technique, called nanosecond pulsed laser annealing, lasts for only 100 nanoseconds and is generated by the same type of laser used in modern-day eye surgeries. Researchers tested the technique on graphite, a material widely used in lithium-ion battery anodes, or positive electrodes. They tested the technique in batches of 10 pulses and 80 pulses and compared the differences in current capacity; power is calculated by multiplying voltage by current.Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in portable electronic devices and electric cars. With further improvements, these batteries could have a major impact on transportation and as storage devices for renewable energy sources like wind and solar.The study showed a number of interesting results, said Jay Narayan, the John C. Fan Family Distinguished Chair in Materials Science at NC State and corresponding author of a paper describing the work. Narayan pioneered the use of lasers to create and manipulate defects in semiconductors in work spanning more than four decades. The work is published in the journal Carbon.\"Material defects can be a nuisance, but if you engineer them correctly you can make them an advantage,\" he said. \"This technique opens the door, so to speak, for lithium ions, so it enhances the current capacity. Graphite anodes consist of steps and grooves on the surface—creating more steps is like creating more doors for lithium ions to get in and get out, which is beneficial.\"The technique also creates defects called vacancies, which are missing atoms, and that helps provide more sites for lithium ions to come and go, which is related to the current capacity.\"Current capacity increased by 20% when the optimal number of pulses was used, which was closer to 10 than to 80 pulses.The study also showed, though, that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing, as too many defects in the graphite anodes can lead to problems.\"Lithium ion has a positive charge, so if it captures an electron it becomes lithium metal, and you don't want that,\" Narayan said. \"Lithium metal shoots out tiny wire dendrites from the graphite anode and can cause a fire. So you want to make sure that a lithium ion doesn't become a metal.\"Narayan said that manufacturers should have the capability to use nanosecond pulse laser annealing when producing both anodes and cathodes, the other electrodes contained in batteries.\"These high-powered lasers exist, and you can treat anodes and cathodes within a microsecond,\" Narayan said. \"The cathodes or anodes are made on a sheet, which makes treatment relatively fast and easy.\"Narayan and colleagues at the University of Texas-Austin recently published another paper that used the same laser technique on cathode materials. Published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, that study showed laser treatment enhanced cathode materials.\"Next, we are trying to eliminate the need for using more expensive materials, such as cobalt in battery cathodes, in order to make higher power and longer-lasting batteries,\" Narayan said.Roger Narayan, Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NC State, co-authored the paper in Carbon along with first author Nayna Khosla, an NC State graduate student.

Sometimes, it’s important to look back at everything that happened this year to get a picture of where next year may be heading or to see what the industry is focusing on.In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the top trends we’ve seen this year.A Rivalry Over 3D NAND LayersSometimes trends spread out over the year, but one certainly stood out above the rest, with companies releasing back-to-back news on NAND technology. This trend came as a bit of a rivalry, as companies one-upped each other on the number of layers and innovations they could pack into NAND memory. The first release to hit our radar was Micron’s 3D NAND flash memory chip, which had 232 layers packed onto it. This chip came as a bit of a surprise, considering the last time Micron announced how many NAND layers it had reached was 176 back in 2020. A rendering of Micron's latest 3D NAND with 232 layers.What was even more of a surprise was that, a week later, SK hynix pushed beyond Micron by creating a 238-layer 4D NAND. The term “4D” is coined by SK hynix, and the difference is that, in a traditional 3D NAND, the periphery circuit is next to the array, while 4D NAND places it underneath.Building up this trend, another release that same week was Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd’s (YMTC) 232-layered X3-9070 3D NAND chip. A week after that, Samsung announced its V-NAND-based solid-state drives (SSDs) for gaming applications. To learn more about V-NAND, you can check out this article. All of these releases show a clear interest in the industry's investment in NAND memory technology. As companies seek to increase memory density, it appears that they are looking towards 3D NAND because of the ability to space out transistor cells to avoid leakages and interference from adjacent cells. This can allow designers to increase memory density without sacrificing performance, thus side-stepping the performance limitations of scaling technology. With so many companies racing to push beyond NAND limitations, it will be interesting to see if more innovations pop up in 2023. I wonder how many layers the next release will be.RISC-V Takes Huge Leap Forward in 2022Since its creation in 2010, RISC-V, an open-source ISA (instruction set architecture), has taken the world by storm. This architecture has found its way into all sorts of nooks and crannies across the electronics industry. From helping ease the ongoing chip shortage to finding its way into space-rated technology, RISC-V is proving to be an ongoing trend year over year, and it doesn’t look like that's about to change anytime soon.One company that made massive strides for RISC-V this year was SiFive. Over the years, All About Circuits has covered SiFive since 2016. What started with an article or two a year has ramped up this year thanks to a plethora of new technology being released. As mentioned a moment ago, RISC-V found its use in space technology with NASA tapping SiFive to leverage its X280, an 8-core RISC-V processor, in a new project. Adding to SiFive’s announcements for the year, it also released: A new version of the X280, which was teased at Embedded World 2022Two processors—the P670 and P470—which added to its Performance line of RISC-V IP-based processorsA portfolio of automotive RISC-V processor coresWith all of these innovations coming out of SiFive this year, it feels obvious that this startup is working toward becoming a major cornerstone of RISC-V. Seeing how quickly this technology is growing, major companies are jumping on board this year as well. Take Intel, for example, which is showing its support by launching the new Intel Pathfinder program. This program is designed to help engineers in the pre-silicon development of RISC-V devices.Another major advancement in RISC-V history this year was the announcement of Alibaba’s RISC-V SoC (system-on-a-chip) powering the ROMA development laptop, thus making this the industry's first laptop using a RISC-V chip.The RISC-V community ended another year with a bang in the form of its annual RISC-V Summit event. Our All About Circuits team (virtually) attended the event. This enabled us to cover interesting RISC-V Summit keynotes, a RISC-V processor core announcement from startup Ventana, and other RISC-V news unveiled at the event.Looking back at all of these RISC-V news items from this year (there were still plenty more I didn't touch on here), it's apparent that RISC-V made some enormous leaps in becoming a mainstream technology. Entering into 2023, I can't see its momentum slowing down anytime soon.Quantum Computing Aims for CommercializationOne trend that has been consistently growing year over year is quantum computing. What was once largely based on university research (which is still pumping out new quantum tech) has become part of many big-name companies’ strategies for the future. Take Intel, for example, which took a “software first” approach this year to quantum computing using its platform based on Loihi 2.Another big name, IBM, which is one of the biggest players in the quantum computing world, also had its fair share of the spotlight this year. Notably, in November, IBM announced that it had created a 433-qubit quantum processor called “Osprey.” This processor claims to have tripled the number of qubits over IBM’s Eagle processor released in 2021. Along with this processor, IBM also revealed its latest roadmap and goals for 2023, which you can read about in this article. Seeing a year-over-year improvement like this example from IBM helps show that quantum computing isn’t just a trendy new technology; it is quickly gaining ground in the mainstream market thanks to some startups. Throwing their hats into the quantum computing ring this year, many startups made waves that could lead to more advancements in 2023, especially concerning the commercialization of quantum computing. Take one U.K.-based company, Quantum Motion, which, back in October, demonstrated that its “Bloomsbury” quantum chip could be created using the same manufacturing processes for standard semiconductors. This announcement followed Intel’s notification that same month that it hit a new milestone toward producing silicon-based qubits. These efforts kick off the idea that quantum computing technology is steadily heading toward mass production.As the commercialization and manufacturing limitations of quantum computing hardware continue to be at the forefront of the industry, it will be exciting to see how this unfolds throughout the new year. Wi-Fi 6/6E Keeps on Trucking While Wi-Fi 7 Hardware DebutsReleased back in 2021, the Wi-Fi 7 standard had a pivotal year in 2022. Though companies are still creating and focusing on technology working within the Wi-Fi 6 standard (released in 2019), some companies like Qualcomm are already looking to the future. One reason, as contributor Robert Keim points out, is that, though Wi-Fi 6 focused on driving data to as many devices as possible and had advanced capabilities, it has some shortcommings when it comes to latency and data rates.As mentioned, Qualcomm has been a driving force in pushing towards Wi-Fi 7 with its Wi-Fi 7 Networking Pro platform, which was released back in May. Along with that platform, Qualcomm also announced new RFFE (radio frequency front end) modules to fit within this standard. Another company, MediaTek, is also getting on board with the release of its Filogic 880 and Filogic 380 Wi-Fi 7 platforms. Since the shift towards Wi-Fi 7 has barely begun, companies are still innovating around Wi-Fi 6. Back in January of this year, the Wi-Fi Alliance released the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6 Release 2, which affects the Wi-Fi 6E version. Overall, this release was aimed at the Internet of Things (IoT) to increase power efficiency and performance, and designers can now leverage this standard in their devices while Wi-Fi 7 technology is still trying to break into the industry. All in all, 2023 is sure to have more news about both Wi-Fi 6/6E and Wi-Fi 7. In-memory Compute Shakes Off Memory LimitationsA final trend we’ve seen in 2022 is in-memory compute. This one has been big the past few years and has continued into this year. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be integrated into more and more devices, it comes with a few limitations, namely attributes like speed, processing, and storage capacity. To combat these challenges, engineers are looking for better memory architectures.Though there is still a lot to be accomplished with in-memory computing, some universities are trying to break the mold with their research. Take the NeuRRAM from UCSD, Stanford, Tsinghua, and Notre Dame. The NeuRRAM is a resistive random access memory (RRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) neuromorphic chip. This chip made strides in the space of in-memory processing by having “48 neurosynaptic cores, 256 CMOS neurons, and 65,536 RRAM cells,” all of which can do parallel processing and support data and model parallelism. The NeuRRAM chip.Another release targeting in-memory compute that happened this year came from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Researchers from UPenn showed how analog in-memory compute circuits could be created using specialized materials and without transistors. This architecture leveraged aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) to create memory blocks and a convolution neural network (CNN) using a ferroelectric diode (FeD) array. This combo helped the researchers demonstrate that in-memory computing is reachable and that the von Neumann bottleneck can be bypassed. Aside from university research into in-memory compute, some companies are trying to take it to a more mainstream level. Take the startup Axelera AI, which got funding this fall to commercialize its AI acceleration platform, combining multicore in-memory compute with a specialized dataflow architecture. You can read up on this company in a startup spotlight article here. As researchers and companies focus on making in-memory compute a more tangible reality, I’m sure we will see even more developments in 2023. The Outlook for 2023 is PromisingI know I only pulled apart just a few trends of 2022, but after looking back at even just these five, it’s exciting to see all of the technology that helped us get to another year. These five trends (and many more) have barely started to crescendo. Next year is sure to keep the momentum going and will bring us many new innovations, some we might never have thought previously possible.

With its ultrahigh energy density, the new cathode material promises longer driving ranges on one charge. Reported in Energy Advances and patented with Rospatent, the material is a familiar nickel-rich layered transition metal oxide, but with an altered microstructure that packs more energy per unit volume.\"Cathode materials are an important bottleneck as far as electric vehicle batteries are concerned,\" principal investigator Professor Artem Abakumov from Skoltech Energy commented. \"The cathodes in batteries powering electric cars tend to use layered transition metal oxides, including nickel-rich ones. We improved two commonly used materials of this kind, achieving a 10% to 25% increase in energy density. This translates into smaller cathodes, more compact batteries, and therefore greater energy storage capacity for the same volume. As an added bonus, the material is slower to deteriorate.\"The layered oxide originally used in battery cathodes had the formula LiCoO2. In currently used materials, some of the cobalt atoms are replaced by nickel and manganese. These materials are known by technical names such as NMC811, where the numbers reflect the ratio between the three elements in the chemical formula—for example, eight nickel atoms per one atom of manganese and one atom of cobalt. Without changing their chemical composition, Skoltech researchers improved NMC811 and its cousin NMC622 by tweaking the materials' microstructural organization.Conventional NMCs are powdered polycrystalline materials, meaning that each secondary particle is made up of randomly oriented grains. The crystal structure within any given grain is nearly flawless, but since no two grains fit perfectly together, some empty spaces inevitably arise at grain boundaries. The single-crystal counterparts of polycrystalline NMCs are just what the name says: Each powder particle is basically one large grain with no wasted spaces in it. These single crystals are usually octahedron-shaped.\"Our material is a single-crystal NMC with spherical particles, combining the best of both worlds as far as maximizing density goes. Unlike polycrystals, the powder particles don't have internal structure, so there are no wasted spaces at grain boundaries. But on top of that, you can also pack more spherically shaped single crystals into the same limited volume than octahedron-shaped ones, so you get more density on that account, too,\" study co-author Skoltech Research Scientist Aleksandra Savina said.Besides denser packing, the spherical shape of the crystals reduces the area of contact with the electrolyte, minimizing unwanted interactions that over time cause cathode degradation due to crack formation in the particles of conventional NMCs. This should prolong the operating life of the cathode and battery on the whole.To alter the layered oxide morphology, Skoltech researchers tweaked the synthesis procedure, which relies on the so-called flux method.Ordinarily, you start with a precursor with homogeneously distributed nickel, manganese, and cobalt. You mix in lithium hydroxide or some other source of lithium, and anneal at high temperature.\"What we do is after adding the lithium-containing compound, we also mix in an inert salt that has a low melting point, and we melt that mixture and anneal at high temperature. We then wash away the salt and anneal again to get rid of the products of any unwanted reactions with water. But the key is that depending on which inert salt is used and in what amount, the particle geometry will change. With conventional synthesis, on the other hand, there's really not much you can do to affect morphology,\" study co-author and Skoltech MSc student Alina Pavlova explained.The team identified the salt parameters that promoted spherical particle formation. Tests confirmed that the resulting material had the same energy storage capacity per unit mass as the commercial analogs but had greater energy density, enabling more power to be packed into the same limited space.Asked about their future plans, the researchers said they intended to experiment with particle size, combining smaller and larger spheres for an even denser packing. The team will also pursue layered transition metal oxides that would replace even more cobalt and manganese atoms with nickel, further enhancing energy storage capacity.", "abstract": "近日，由俄罗斯斯科尔科沃科技学院的研究团队开发出了一种新型阴极材料，可用于为电动汽车提供动力的锂离子电池，凭借其超高的能量密度，有望让电动汽车在进行一次充电之后有更长的行驶里程。该材料是一种常见的富镍层状过渡金属氧化物，但具有改变的微观结构，每单位体积可容纳更多能量。研究人员表示，研究该材料的重点在于锂离子电池的阴极，这个电极是由被称为纳米金属簇（NMC）的层状过渡金属氧化物制成。研究人员通过调整合成程序来改变两种常见的纳米金属簇构型，去除两个粒子相遇时边界处的空隙，使得新型阴极材料可以提供高达25%的能量密度增长。下一步，研究人员打算通过试验颗粒大小，将更小或更大的球体组合在一起，以获得更密集的堆积。并且还将寻求层状过渡金属氧化物，用镍取代更多的钴和锰原子，进一步提高电池的储能能力。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-cathode-material-electric-vehicle-batteries.html"}, {"title": "GaN Systems推出体积缩小50%的快速充电器", "keyword": "快速充电器 交钥匙方案 高功率密度 功率晶体管", "content_zh": "GAN Systems将140W快速充电器缩小50%GAN Systems宣布提供140W交直流充电器参考设计，配有USB PD3.1，单端口Type-C输出。与硅基充电器相比，该设计据说轻40%，小50%，具有23W/in3的超高功率密度。 这一设计增强了GaN系统公司为消费电子市场提供的(65W、100W、140W、250W)全包充电器解决方案，使设计周期更快，并继续推出更小、更轻、更强大和更高效的充电器。这款新的140W GaN充电器是一个完整的全包解决方案，包括完整组装和测试充电器的全面文档。 该快速充电器提供高频，2级电源拓扑与无桥图腾柱功率因数校正和双开关QR反激拓扑。 它使用GaN系统公司的5×6毫米PDFN封装的GS-065-011-1-L功率晶体管。GaN系统公司战略营销副总裁保罗·维纳说：“笔记本和笔记本电脑是我们个人和职业生活中越来越重要的一部分，因此对便携性和移动性的需求继续增加。” “随着工作空间的定义继续倾向于混合模式，从办公室到家庭，到咖啡馆和其他地方，我们想要更轻、更小的设备--充电器一直在努力跟上步伐。 GaN Systems致力于使GaN易于使用，新的140W GaN充电器设计是这一承诺的另一个例子。“新设计是在GaN Systems宣布哈曼新的InfinityLab InstantCharger 100W，4 USB GaN充电器后推出的，该充电器使用GaN Systems的晶体管。 ", "content_en": "GaN Systems Shrinks 140W Fast-Charger By 50 PercentGaN Systems has announced the availability of a turnkey 140W AC/DC charger reference design with USB PD3.1, Single Port Type-C Output.Compared to silicon-based chargers, this design is said to be 40 percent lighter and 50 percent smaller, featuring an ultra-high-power density of 23W/in3.

Meanwhile, the digital computers that today’s world runs on are a far cry away, leaving researchers to wonder where the discrepancy is and how we can bridge that gap.One enormous difference between the human brain and a digital computer is how computation is done. In digital computers, electrons are manipulated through semiconductor materials. In the brain, ions are manipulated in liquid.In an attempt to replicate this process, researchers at Harvard University recently published a paper describing a new ionic circuit. In this article, we’ll be talking about ionic computing as well as the new research from Harvard.What is an Ionic Circuit?By and large, the physiological processes that living organisms rely on are governed by the selective transport of ions across aqueous environments. For example, cells function based on the biological channels across their membranes which facilitate the exchange of ions and molecules both within the cell and external to the cell.To the discerning observer, one may realize that this, in itself, is a type of circuit, albeit not in the more conventional sense. And, while these “ionic circuits” are not necessarily conventional, it is well understood that, in many ways, their performance and characteristics far exceed those of digital computers.Even though ions in water may move slower than electrons in semiconductors, many believe that the diversity of ionic species can lend themselves to a richer field of information processing that could benefit fields such as machine learning.Hence, to try and harness this behavior, researchers have sought after ionic circuits, where the movement of ions in aqueous solutions can mimic conventional computing techniques. So far, research attempts have been successful in creating components for ionic circuitry, such as diodes or transistors, but no one has created a full circuit out of ionic components.New Harvard ResearchResearchers at Harvard University challenged that narrative when they published its paper describing a new ionic circuit for machine learning computation. Specifically, in their paper, the researchers describe creating an analog multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) block out of an ionic circuit.The building block of the MAC was a novel type of ionic transistor that leveraged earlier research from Harvard in which researchers found that they were able to electronically program the pH of certain aqueous solutions.In the MAC research, the team created an ionic transistor consisting of two concentric ring electrodes with a central disk electrode within a solution consisting of quinone molecules. The device works to electrochemically manipulate the pH around the center disk through the production of hydrogen atoms, at which point the center disk can generate an ionic current into the water that is proportional to the local pH. In this way, the pH of the solution acts as a transistor gate and effectively creates an ionic transistor.Then, to go from transistor to MAC, the team architected the transistors in such a way that the total ionic current is equivalent to the multiplication of the individual transistor’s currents. These multiplication cells were then arranged in a 16x16 array to create a matrix multiplication block. Hence, using pH control and their unique ionic transistors, the researchers were able to make a MAC block with applications in machine learning computation.Useful Applications?While the Harvard research team admits that their new ionic MAC is nowhere near as fast as conventional digital MACs, they do believe it holds the potential to eventually be more efficient than conventional solutions. Ideally, the researchers hope that ionic circuits can serve as a more efficient and rich computing resource for applications like edge computing.", "abstract": "近日，美国哈佛大学工程与应用科学学院 （SEAS）团队与生物技术初创公司DNA Script合作，开发出首个由数百个离子晶体管组成的离子电路，并执行了神经网络计算的核心过程。研究团队构建了由醌分子水溶液组成新型离子晶体管，与两个同心环形电极和一个中心圆盘电极相连，施加在中心圆盘上的电压会引起电化学反应，从而产生从圆盘到水中的离子电流，两个环形电极通过产生和捕获氢离子来调节中心盘周围的局部pH值，从而加快或降低反应速率，也就是增加或减少离子电流。此外，研究团队还设计了pH门控离子晶体管，使得圆盘电流是圆盘电压和代表局部pH门控晶体管的“权重”参数的算术乘积，并将这些晶体管组织成16×16阵列，以将单个晶体管的模拟算术乘法扩展为模拟矩阵乘法。未来，该团队希望进一步丰富系统的化学复杂性，计划使用更多样化的离子种类来实现离子晶体管中的门控和离子传输。", "link": "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/harvard-made-ionic-circuit-computes-in-water/"}, {"title": "美国开发出新型柔性生物传感器", "keyword": "柔性生物传感器 有机电化学晶体管 一氧化氮", "content_zh": "新型植入式传感器嗅出骨关节炎的可能信号：烟雾表明火灾，一氧化氮表明炎症。 这种化学介质促进炎症，但研究人员怀疑，在前交叉韧带(ACL)断裂和相关损伤后，它的工作做得太好，并引发早发性骨关节炎。 宾夕法尼亚州立大学工程科学和力学纪念副教授小詹姆斯·亨德森（James E.Henderson Jr.）环宇“拉里”程（Larry Cheng）表示，通常情况下，退行性疾病只有在出现进展性症状后才会被诊断出来，但它可能会通过一氧化氮监测更早地被识别。程和他的学生刘尚斌（Shangbin Liu）今年在宾夕法尼亚州立大学获得了工程科学和力学硕士学位，他们与中国的研究人员合作开发了一种灵活的生物传感器，能够在兔子身上连续无线检测一氧化氮。 他们在《国家科学院院刊》上发表了他们的方法。程说：“对与炎症相关的生物标志物的实时评估，如关节腔中的一氧化氮，可以表明骨关节炎最初发展过程中的病理演变，为优化创伤性膝关节损伤后的治疗提供必要的信息。”程说，挑战在于一氧化氮检测需要高度灵敏和稳定的电化学传感器，这些传感器也是灵活和生物相容的，以便能够准确地绘制一氧化氮的地理来源。 本文作者、清华大学材料科学与工程学院副教授蓝音此前曾领导开发了一种灵活的、对一氧化氮敏感的电化学传感器，但它依赖于限制其能力的电极结构。“有限的表面积使得同时实现高灵敏度和高空间分辨率具有挑战性，”尹说，这意味着该设备可能能够检测一氧化氮，但可能无法准确定位其来源，因此尚不清楚信号是否与损伤部位或周围组织有关。 “为了确保理想的准确性，还需要定期重新校准。”研究人员调整了传感机制中的通道几何形状，以优化气体在检测前进入传感通道的方式。 插入图像突出显示沟道的漏极(D)、长度(L)、源极(S)和宽度(W)。 功劳：刘尚斌/宾夕法尼亚州立大学/清华大学研究人员转向灵活和生物兼容的有机电化学晶体管（OECTs）的潜在解决方案，这种晶体管可以利用电压和电流来识别和放大信号。 即使是很小的离子浓度，一旦它们在栅电极上氧化并驱动电解质离子进入器件的沟道，也可以检测和放大； 然而，该通道是由一种名为PEDOT：PSS的聚合物制成的，通常工作在与一氧化氮不同的栅极电压下。程说：“我们调整了通道几何形状和栅极材料，以调整一氧化氮电化学信号进入通道的方式以及设备检测它们的方式，优化了传感能力。” “与以前报道的电化学一氧化氮传感器相比，这种带有小型化主动传感区域的无参考传感器能够以更高的空间分辨率进行一氧化氮检测，这可以让电化学信号的映射提供全面的诊断信息。”研究人员将传感器与定制的电路模块集成在一起，产生了一种持续无线监测一氧化氮水平的设备，该设备通过蓝牙传输到手机应用程序。 为了测试这一设计，研究人员将这些装置植入了兔子体内。 八天多的时间里，研究人员发现这些设备成功检测到了一氧化氮浓度。程说：“结果表明，高一氧化氮浓度的早期迹象可能与后期炎症和软骨变性有关，这可能为评估前交叉韧带损伤后向骨关节炎的进展和优化创伤后治疗提供必要的信息。”程说，研究人员计划继续调查一氧化氮浓度和骨关节炎之间的联系，并完善传感技术。“总的来说， 所提出的材料选择和设备设计可以为早期解码健康状况和最大限度地提高相关退化和疾病的治疗结果提供关键的工程基础，“尹说。 ", "content_en": "Novel implantable sensor sniffs out possible signals of osteoarthritisIf smoke indicates a fire, nitric oxide signals inflammation. The chemical mediator promotes inflammation, but researchers suspect it can do its job too well after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and related injuries and initiate early onset osteoarthritis.

Corresponding author Lan Yin, associate professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Tsinghua University in China, previously led the development of a flexible, nitric oxide-sensitive electrochemical sensor, but it relied on an electrode configuration that restricted its capabilities.\"The limited surface area made it challenging to simultaneously attain both high sensitivity and high spatial resolution,\" Yin said, meaning the device may be able to detect nitric oxide, but may not be able to pinpoint exactly where it originated, so it was not clear if the signal was related to the injury site or surrounding tissue. \"Recalibration was also required on a regular basis to ensure desirable accuracy.\"Researchers tuned the channel geometry in the sensing mechanism to optimize how the gas enters the sensing channel prior to detection.

Even small ion concentrations are detectable and amplifiable once they oxidize on the gate electrode and drive ions of the electrolyte into the device's channel; however, the channel is made of a polymer, known as PEDOT:PSS, that often operates at a different gate voltage than nitric oxide.\"We tuned the channel geometry and gate materials to align how the nitric oxide electrochemical signals enter the channel and how the device detects them, optimizing the sensing capabilities,\" Cheng said. \"The reference-free sensor with a miniaturized active sensing region enables nitric oxide detection with improved spatial resolution compared with previously reported electrochemical nitric oxide sensors, which could allow the mapping of electrochemical signals to offer comprehensive diagnostic information.\"The researchers integrated the sensors with a customized circuit module, resulting in a device that continuously and wirelessly monitors nitric oxide levels, which are transmitted via Bluetooth to a cell phone app. To test the design, the researchers implanted the devices in rabbits. Over eight days, the researchers found that the devices successfully detected nitric oxide concentrations.\"The results indicate that early signs of high nitric oxide concentrations could be correlated with inflammation and cartilage degeneration at the later stage, which could potentially offer essential information to evaluate the progression to osteoarthritis after ACL injury and optimize posttraumatic treatments,\" Cheng said.The researchers plan to continue investigating the connection between nitric oxide concentrations and osteoarthritis and refining the sensing technology, according to Cheng.\"Overall, the proposed materials options and device design could offer critical engineering basis for decoding health conditions at an early stage and maximizing therapeutic outcomes of associated degeneration and disorders,\" Yin said.", "abstract": "近日，美国宾夕法尼亚州立大学研究人员开发出一种柔性生物传感器，它能够植入兔子体内，连续通过无线检测一氧化氮。这种传感器使用了一种柔性且生物兼容的有机电化学晶体管，它可以利用电压和电流来识别和放大信号，即使是很小的离子浓度，只要在栅电极上氧化并驱动电解液的离子进入器件的通道，也可以被检测和放大。研究人员还调整了通道的几何形状，以校准一氧化氮电化学信号进入通道的方式和设备检测方式。与以前的一些电化学一氧化氮传感器相比，这种新型传感器能够以更高的空间分辨率检测一氧化氮，为电化学信号映射提供全面诊断信息。为了测试其性能，研究人员将设备植入兔子体内，发现该设备成功地检测到了一氧化氮的浓度并通过蓝牙将信号传输到手机中。这一研究成果为在早期阶段解码健康状况打下了基础，并将有望提高关节炎等疾病的治疗效果。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-09-implantable-sensor-osteoarthritis.html"}, {"title": "美国成功将CMOS时钟电路安装在智能微型机器人上", "keyword": "智能微型机器人 外部控制 板载电路 微米级", "content_zh": "研究人员将电子“大脑”放在行走的微型机器人上虽然微米级机器人通常由外部控制，但康奈尔大学的原型包括自主微型机器人上的电路。康奈尔大学的一组研究人员成功地在一个由太阳能供电的智能微型机器人上安装了“大脑”。这些微型机器人的尺寸从100到250微米--几乎是一根头发丝的宽度。 虽然这种大小的机器人通常由外部控制，但康奈尔的原型包括一个控制运动的车载电路。 近年来，康奈尔大学的研究人员开发了一种可以爬行、行走、游泳和形成弯曲形状的微型机器。 然而，这些微型机器人的运动是由电线或聚焦激光束控制的。 康奈尔大学艺术与科学学院的物理学教授伊泰·科恩（Itai Cohen）召集了一组研究人员，寻找消除外部控制的方法，以便微型机器人能够自己自由移动。 过去，研究人员在没有引线键合和多芯片堆叠的情况下，努力将微型机器人扩展到微米级。 典型的CMOS电路包括不同功能的各种引线键合，但这增加了IC的深度、高度和重量，使其难以缩小。 另一个主要挑战是将CMOS IC和微致动器异质集成，成为一个单一的、全功能的机器人。康奈尔大学的研究人员将表面电化学致动器（SEA）和硅光伏（PVs）结合起来，以克服这些挑战。 一旦从CMOS电路接收到电压信号，氧分子就会附着并膨胀到该层，导致执行器弯曲机器人的腿。 Microbott的“大脑”和制造康奈尔大学的研究人员声称Microbott的“大脑”是一个简单的CMOS时钟电路，实现了一系列晶体管、二极管、电阻和电容。 这个IC产生一个信号来产生一系列相移的方波频率来控制机器人的步态。 在测试阶段，几个微型机器人可以在每秒4到20微米之间移动。 研究团队克服的最后一个障碍是制作过程。 这一过程需要13层光刻，12个蚀刻和11个沉积从10种不同的材料。 利用康奈尔公司的纳米科技设施(CNF)，研究人员最终完成了一个8英寸的绝缘体上硅晶圆。 有了这个晶圆，Microbot的光伏电源和CMOS时钟电路没有干扰机器人的腿部运动。 微型机器人有两对基于光伏的电源，微型机器人有腿部运动和时钟电路的专用电源。 CMOS时钟电路由一个张弛振荡器组成，该振荡器作为时钟输出和频率驱动器。 频率驱动器由一系列D型触发器组成，将脉冲转换为50%的占空比，使机器人可以轻松地在每个输出针脚上发送信号。在测试阶段，康奈尔大学的研究人员发现，在大约1和3千瓦/平方米的连续光强下，微型机器人的速度达到12微米/秒，每分钟行驶大约3个身体长度。 虽然研究人员本可以通过将输入频率推到4赫兹来提高速度，但该小组将工作频率保持在1到2赫兹之间，这样微型机器人就不会在平坦的表面上滑倒。 这种微型机器人在清理、监测甚至手术方面的潜力康奈尔大学的研究人员认为，这些微型机器人可以用于环境清理、医疗物质监测和显微手术。 例如，这些微型机器人可能被用作伤口愈合和组织形态形成的智能机器人。康奈尔大学的研究人员正在寻求结合机器学习算法，这样微型机器人就可以独立学习和适应。 该团队希望在未来的研究中扩展Microbot家族，实现更复杂的任务和基于人工智能的算法。 ", "content_en": "Researchers Put Electronic“Brains”Onboard Walking MicrobotsWhile micrometer-scale robots are usually controlled externally, Cornell's prototypes include a circuit onboard the autonomous microrobots.A group of researchers at Cornell University have successfully installed \"brains\" onboard an intelligent microscale robot powered by solar energy.These microbots measure from 100 to 250 micrometers—nearly the width of a single strand of human hair. While robots this size are usually controlled externally, Cornell's prototypes include an onboard circuit to control movements. Creating a Wireless Walking RobotIn recent years, researchers at Cornell have developed microscopic machines that can crawl, walk, swim, and form bends in their shape. These microbots' movements were dictated by wires or focused laser beams, however. Itai Cohen, a professor of physics in the college of arts and sciences at Cornell, brought together a group of researchers to find ways to remove external controls so the microbots could move freely on their own. In the past, researchers struggled to scale microrobots to micron levels without wire bonding and multichip stacking. Typical CMOS circuitry includes various wire bonds for different functionalities, but this increases the depth, height, and weight of the IC, making it difficult to scale down. Another major challenge is heterogeneously integrating CMOS ICs and microactuators to become a single, fully-functional robot.Cornell researchers combined surface electrochemical actuators (SEAs) and silicon photovoltaics (PVs) to overcome these challenges. Once a voltage signal is received from the CMOS circuit, oxygen molecules cling and expand to the layer, causing the actuator to bend the robot’s legs. The \"Brain\" and Fabrication of the MicrobotCornell researchers claim the \"brain\" of the microbot is a simple CMOS clock circuit that implements an array of transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors. This IC generates a signal to produce a series of phase-shifted square wave frequencies that control a robot’s gait. During the testing phase, several microbots could move between 4 to 20 micrometers per second. The last hurdle the research team overcame was the fabrication process. This process required 13 layers of photolithography, 12 etches, and 11 depositions from 10 different materials. Using Cornell’s Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility (CNF), the researchers finally completed an 8-inch silicon-on-insulator wafer. With this wafer, the microbot's PV power supply and CMOS clock circuit did not interfere with the robot’s leg movement. Solar Powering the MicrobotWith two pairs of photovoltaic-based power supplies, the microbot had dedicated power for leg movement and the clock circuit. The CMOS clock circuit consisted of a relaxation oscillator, which served as a clock output and a frequency driver. The frequency driver comprised a series of D-type flip-flops that converted pulses to a 50% duty cycle, allowing the robot to easily send signals throughout each output pin.During the testing phase, Cornell researchers discovered with about 1 and 3 kW/m2 of continuous light intensity, the microbot reached 12 μm/s in speed, traveling about 3-body lengths a minute. While the researchers could have increased the speed by pushing the input frequency to 4 Hz, the team kept operating frequencies between 1 and 2 Hz, so the microbot wouldn't slip on flat surfaces. The Microbot's Potential for Cleanup, Monitoring, and Even SurgeryCornell researchers believe these microbots could be used for environmental cleanup, medical substance monitoring, and microscopic surgery. For example, these microbots might be used as intelligent robots for wound healing and tissue morphogenesis.Cornell researchers are looking to incorporate machine learning algorithms, so the microbots can learn and adapt independently. The team hopes to expand on the microbot family with more complex tasks and AI-based algorithms in future studies.", "abstract": "近日，美国康奈尔大学的一组研究人员成功将CMOS时钟电路安装在由太阳能驱动的智能微型机器人上。该电路可当作控制微型机器人行走的“大脑”。为消除可由外部控制小尺寸机器人的因素，研究人员设计了一个板载电路控制机器人行为，以使微型机器人能够自由移动。同时结合表面电化学致动器(SEA)和硅光伏 (PV)技术，实现在没有引线键合和多芯片堆叠的情况下，将微型机器人扩展到微米级。研究人员称，微型机器人的“大脑”是一个简单的CMOS时钟电路，实现了晶体管、二极管、电阻器和电容器的阵列，使测试阶段的微型机器人能够每秒4到20微米。此外，通过纳米科学技术设施 (CNF)制造出的8英寸绝缘体上的硅晶片，能够帮助微型机器人的光伏电源和CMOS时钟电路不干扰机器人的腿部运动，从而实现真正的自由。该项研究拓展了微型机器人的应用范围，提高了通过更复杂的任务和基于人工智能的算法扩展微型机器人家族的可能性。", "link": "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/researchers-put-electronic-brains-onboard-walking-microbots/"}, {"title": "日本利用固体电解质研发出新型耐热大容量电容器", "keyword": "全固态电容器 耐热高容量 固体电解质 固体无机材料 ", "content_zh": "从全固态电池中借用固体电解质制造出的新型耐热、高容量电容器电容器是由两个电极和一个电解质组成的储能设备，由于电极-电解质界面上的电荷吸附和解吸特性，它们能够快速充放电。 由于电容器的储能不涉及化学反应，其储能能力低于锂离子电池，但对于需要大电流反复充电的可再生能源的功率调平、火车和电动或混合动力汽车的再生制动能量，以及防止因雷击导致设备故障的瞬时压降补偿装置都很有用。 在不久的将来，它们还有望用于可穿戴设备的储能。大多数电容器使用低沸点的液体电解质，只能在80℃以下使用。 以固体无机材料为介质的陶瓷电容器可以在80℃以上的温度下使用，但其储能容量远低于液体电解质电容器，限制了其在电子电路中的应用。为了提高电容器的储能能力，必须在电极与电解质的界面处有较大的接触面积。 使用固体电解质很难形成大的接触面积； 因此，长期以来，人们一直渴望制造一种高存储容量的电容器，这种电容器也可以在高温下工作。大坂都市大学工学研究生院的Akitoshi Hayashi教授领导的一个研究小组开发了一种高度变形的固体电解质，允许它与电极有很大的接触面积，该电极被开发用于氧化物基全固态电池。在这项研究中，他们使用同样的高度变形固体电解质和碳制备了一种复合材料， 然后用它来构造体型全固态电容器的两个电极。 这款电容器能够在200-300°C的温度下实现高电流密度和大容量充放电，创造了世界上第一款块状全固态电容器。 研究人员预计，他们的电容器将用于改善高温环境下的技术，由于这些技术限制，这种技术以前无法开发。“实现这种电容器的关键是将我们一直在为全固态锂电池开发的固体氧化物电解质--结合了优异的变形性和锂离子导电性--应用于电容器，”Hayashi教授解释说。未来，研究人员希望通过控制固体电解质和碳之间的化学反应，构建能量密度更高的全固态混合电容器， 然后将它们与用于锂离子电池的正极材料结合。这项研究发表在《电源杂志》上。 ", "content_en": "New heat-tolerant, high-capacity capacitor created with solid electrolytes borrowed from all-solid-state batteriesCapacitors are energy storage devices—consisting of two electrodes and an electrolyte—that are capable of rapid charging and discharging because of charge adsorption and desorption properties at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Because capacitors' energy storage does not involve chemical reactions, their storage capacity is lower than that of lithium-ion batteries, but they are useful for power leveling for renewable energy that requires repeated charging at high currents, regenerative braking energy for trains and electric or hybrid cars, as well as instantaneous voltage drop compensation devices that prevent equipment failure due to lightning strikes. They are also expected to be used to store energy for wearable devices in the near future.Most capacitors use a liquid electrolyte with a low boiling point, which can only be used at temperatures below 80℃. Ceramic capacitors that use solid inorganic materials as a dielectric can be used at temperatures above 80℃, but their storage capacity is much lower than liquid electrolyte capacitors, which limits their use to electronic circuits.To increase the energy storage of capacitors, it is necessary to have a large contact area at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. Making a large contact area is difficult using solid electrolytes; so, the creation of a capacitor with high storage capacity that can also operate at high temperatures has been desired for a long time.A research group led by Professor Akitoshi Hayashi at the Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Metropolitan University, has developed a solid electrolyte that is highly deformable, allowing it to have a large contact area with an electrode, which was developed to be used for an oxide-based all-solid-state battery.In this study, they fabricated a composite using the same highly deformable solid electrolyte and carbon, then used it to construct both electrodes for a bulk-type all-solid-state capacitor. This capacitor is capable of high current densities and high-capacity charging and discharging at temperatures of 200-300°C, creating the world's first bulk-type all-solid-state capacitors.

The time that it takes for the system to snap an image and deliver the data to the microprocessor for image processing could mean the difference between avoiding an obstacle or getting into a major accident.In-sensor image processing, in which important features are extracted from raw data by the image sensor itself instead of the separate microprocessor, can speed up the visual processing. To date, demonstrations of in-sensor processing have been limited to emerging research materials which are, at least for now, difficult to incorporate into commercial systems.Now, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed the first in-sensor processor that could be integrated into commercial silicon imaging sensor chips––known as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors––that are used in nearly all commercial devices that need capture visual information, including smartphones.The research is published in Nature Electronics.\"Our work can harnesses the mainstream semiconductor electronics industry to rapidly bring in-sensor computing to a wide variety of real-world applications,\" said Donhee Ham, the Gordon McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics at SEAS and senior author of the paper.Ham and his team developed a silicon photodiode array. Commercially-available image sensing chips also have a silicon photodiode array to capture images, but the team's photodiodes are electrostatically doped, meaning that sensitivity of individual photodiodes, or pixels, to incoming light can be tuned by voltages. An array that connects multiple voltage-tunable photodiodes together can perform an analog version of multiplication and addition operations central to many image processing pipelines, extracting the relevant visual information as soon as the image is captured.\"These dynamic photodiodes can concurrently filter images as they are captured, allowing for the first stage of vision processing to be moved from the microprocessor to the sensor itself,\" said Houk Jang, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and first author of the paper.The silicon photodiode array can be programmed into different image filters to remove unnecessary details or noise for various applications. An imaging system in an autonomous vehicle, for example, may call for a high-pass filter to track lane markings, while other applications may call for a filter that blurs for noise reduction.\"Looking ahead, we foresee the use of this silicon-based in-sensor processor not only in machine vision applications, but also in bio-inspired applications, wherein early information processing allows for the co-location of sensor and compute units, like in the brain,\" said Henry Hinton, a graduate student at SEAS and co-first author of the paper.Next, the team aims to increase the density of photodiodes and integrate them with silicon integrated circuits.\"By replacing the standard non-programmable pixels in commercial silicon image sensors with the programmable ones developed here, imaging devices can intelligently trim out unneeded data, thus could be made more efficient in both energy and bandwidth to address the demands of the next generation of sensory applications,\" said Jang.", "abstract": "近日，美国哈佛大学研究人员开发出一款新型图像传感器。目前，自动驾驶汽车所使用的传感器需要将系统拍摄的图像数据传送到单独的微处理器进行图像处理，这一过程所需的时间可能导致重大事故的发生。为解决这一问题，研究人员开发出首款名为互补金属氧化物半导体(CMOS)图像传感器的传感器处理器。这个处理器中集成了一个新开发的硅基光电二极管阵列，该阵列中的发光电二极管是静电掺杂的，意味着单个二极管对入射光的灵敏度可通过电压来控制调节。将多个电压可调发光二极管连接在一起的阵列可以执行复杂的操作，因此一旦捕捉到图像它就可以提取相关的视觉信息，而不需要时间来进行数据传送。这种新的图像传感器将有望应用于所有需要捕捉视觉信息的设备。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-silicon-image-sensor.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出可调整充电锂电池性能的新技术", "keyword": "阳极表面 人工钝化层 固体粉末 枝晶 充放电循环", "content_zh": "在电极上刷薄膜可以保存电池。一点点的刷可能是制造更好的可充电锂电池的秘密。化学家詹姆斯·图尔的莱斯大学实验室介绍了一种技术，通过在电池阳极上刷粉末来调节电池阳极的表面。 这种粉末附着在阳极上，成为一层薄薄的锂化涂层，有效地防止了破坏性树枝的形成。将磷和硫粉末研磨到锂金属箔表面，表明它的表面能可以调节，而不需要有毒溶剂。 在测试电池中，经过如此修饰并与锂-铁-磷酸-氧化物阴极配对的阳极显示，在340次充放电循环后，它们比现成的电池保留了70%的容量。这项研究发表在《先进材料》上。“这将简化高容量电池的制造，同时大大改善它们，”图尔说。 “将这些粉末状固体砂磨成锂金属阳极，极大地减少了可能使电池短路的枝晶形成，以及材料的加速消耗。”主要作者、赖斯研究生陈伟银和他的实验室同事在电极上使用必要的弯管润滑脂来测试各种候选粉末。 他们首先刷表面使其具有纹理，然后刷粉末以形成与锂金属反应的精细薄膜，并形成固体钝化层。陈和合著者罗德里戈·萨尔瓦蒂拉（Rodrigo Salvatierra）曾是博士后研究员，现在是Tour实验室的学术访客，他们构建了测试电池，并确定处理后的阳极保持了超低极化--锂离子电池的另一个破坏性特征--超过4000小时，大约是裸锂阳极的8倍。Tour说粉末有效地调节了电极的表面能， 使材料的行为更加均匀。“这提供了一个金属复合表面，防止锂金属从阳极流失，这是锂金属电池的一个常见问题，”图尔说。 “锂金属电池的容量远远超过传统的锂离子电池，但锂金属通常很难重复充电。”“锂金属表面的粉末产生了人工钝化层，提高了整个充放电循环的稳定性，”陈说。 “使用这种刷上方法，金属表面被稳定，以便可以安全地充电。”为了表明这项技术可能有更广泛的应用，实验室还将粉末研磨成钠电极，并发现该过程极大地稳定了其电压过电位。这项研究与图尔和赖斯机械工程师C.弗雷德·希格斯三世最近的发现相一致，即将某些粉末磨入表面可以使其超疏水或高度防水。该论文的合著者是米矾约翰·李和杜伊·梁； 研究生雅各布·贝克汉姆、Nghi La和Jianan Xu，以及学术访客Victor Li。 巡演是T.T. 和W.F。 赵教授是莱斯大学的化学教授，也是计算机科学、材料科学和纳米工程教授。 ", "content_en": "Brushing thin films onto electrodes preserves batteriesA bit of brushing may be the secret to making better rechargeable lithium batteries.The Rice University lab of chemist James Tour introduced a technique to tune the surface of anodes for batteries by simply brushing powders into them. The powder adheres to the anode and becomes a thin, lithiated coating that effectively prevents the formation of damaging dendrites.A powder of phosphorus and sulfur ground into the surface of lithium metal foil demonstrated its surface energy can be tuned without the need for toxic solvents. Anodes so modified and paired with lithium-iron-phosphate-oxide cathodes in test cells showed they retained 70% more capacity after 340 charge-discharge cycles than off-the-shelf batteries.The study appears in Advanced Materials.\"This would simplify the manufacture of high-capacity batteries while greatly improving them,\" Tour said. \"Sanding these powdered solids into a lithium metal anode dramatically reduces dendrite formation that can short circuit a battery, as well as the accelerated consumption of the materials.\"Lead author and Rice graduate student Weiyin Chen and his lab colleagues applied the necessary elbow grease to test a variety of powder candidates on their electrodes.

Now, EPFL chemical engineer Kevin Sivula and his team have made a significant step toward bringing this vision closer to reality. They have developed an ingenious yet simple system that combines semiconductor-based technology with novel electrodes that have two key characteristics: they are porous, to maximize contact with water in the air; and transparent, to maximize sunlight exposure of the semiconductor coating. When the device is simply exposed to sunlight, it takes water from the air and produces hydrogen gas. The results have been published on 4 January 2023 in Advanced Materials.\"To realize a sustainable society, we need ways to store renewable energy as chemicals that can be used as fuels and feedstocks in industry. Solar energy is the most abundant form of renewable energy, and we are striving to develop economically competitive ways to produce solar fuels,\" says Sivula of EPFL's Laboratory for Molecular Engineering of Optoelectronic Nanomaterials and principal investigator of the study.Inspiration from a plant's leafIn their research for renewable fossil-free fuels, the EPFL engineers in collaboration with Toyota Motor Europe, took inspiration from the way plants are able to convert sunlight into chemical energy using carbon dioxide from the air. A plant essentially harvests carbon dioxide and water from its environment, and with the extra boost of energy from sunlight, can transform these molecules into sugars and starches, a process known as photosynthesis. The sunlight's energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds inside of the sugars and starches.The transparent gas diffusion electrodes developed by Sivula and his team, when coated with a light harvesting semiconductor material, indeed act like an artificial leaf, harvesting water from the air and sunlight to produce hydrogen gas. The sunlight's energy is stored in the form of hydrogen bonds.Instead of building electrodes with traditional layers that are opaque to sunlight, their substrate is actually a 3-dimensional mesh of felted glass fibers.Marina Caretti, lead author of the work, says, \"Developing our prototype device was challenging since transparent gas-diffusion electrodes have not been previously demonstrated, and we had to develop new procedures for each step. However, since each step is relatively simple and scalable, I think that our approach will open new horizons for a wide range of applications starting from gas diffusion substrates for solar-driven hydrogen production.\"From liquid water to humidity in the airSivula and other research groups have previously shown that it is possible to perform artificial photosynthesis by generating hydrogen fuel from liquid water and sunlight using a device called a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. A PEC cell is generally known as a device that uses incident light to stimulate a photosensitive material, like a semiconductor, immersed in liquid solution to cause a chemical reaction. But for practical purposes, this process has its disadvantages; e.g., it is complicated to make large-area PEC devices that use liquid.Sivula wanted to show that the PEC technology can be adapted for harvesting humidity from the air instead, leading to the development of their new gas diffusion electrode. Electrochemical cells (e.g., fuel cells) have already been shown to work with gases instead of liquids, but the gas diffusion electrodes used previously are opaque and incompatible with the solar-powered PEC technology.Now, the researchers are focusing their efforts into optimizing the system. What is the ideal fiber size? The ideal pore size? The ideal semiconductors and membrane materials? These are questions that are being pursued in the EU Project Sun-to-X, which is dedicated to advance this technology, and develop new ways to convert hydrogen into liquid fuels.Making transparent, gas-diffusion electrodesIn order to make transparent gas diffusion electrodes, the researchers start with a type of glass wool, which is essentially quartz (also known as silicon oxide) fibers and process it into felt wafers by fusing the fibers together at high temperature. Next, the wafer is coated with a transparent thin film of fluorine-doped tin oxide, known for its excellent conductivity, robustness and ease to scale-up.These first steps result in a transparent, porous, and conducting wafer, essential for maximizing contact with the water molecules in the air and letting photons through. The wafer is then coated again, this time with a thin-film of sunlight-absorbing semiconductor materials. This second thin coating still lets light through, but appears opaque due to the large surface area of the porous substrate. As is, this coated wafer can already produce hydrogen fuel once exposed to sunlight.The scientists went on to build a small chamber containing the coated wafer, as well as a membrane for separating the produced hydrogen gas for measurement. When their chamber is exposed to sunlight under humid conditions, hydrogen gas is produced, achieving what the scientists set out to do, showing that the concept of a transparent gas-diffusion electrode for solar-powered hydrogen gas production can be achieved.While the scientists did not formally study the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in their demonstration, they acknowledge that it is modest for this prototype, and currently less than can be achieved in liquid-based PEC cells. Based on the materials used, the maximum theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the coated wafer is 12%, whereas liquid cells have been demonstrated to be up to 19% efficient.", "abstract": "近日，瑞士洛桑联邦理工学院研究人员开发出能利用空气中水分和太阳能生产氢燃料的新型透明电极。该电极是一种巧妙而简单的系统，呈多孔状，可最大限度地与空气中的水分接触，且电极透明，能最大限度暴露在阳光下。当其暴露在阳光下时，会从空气中吸收水分并产生氢气。与传统不透明电极不同，新电极基底由毡制玻璃纤维组成三维网格。为制造透明气体扩散电极，研究人员利用高温将氧化硅融合在一起加工成毡晶片，然后在晶圆上涂一层用于吸收太阳光能量的掺氟氧化锡透明薄膜。该薄膜涂层可以使光线通过，但由于多孔基板表面积大而显得不透明。事实上，一旦暴露在阳光下，这种涂层晶圆就可以生产氢燃料。实验测试表明该涂层晶圆的最大太阳能-氢气转换效率高达12%。该研究成果将有望加速氢能源技术的发展和应用。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-solar-fuels-thin-air.html"}, {"title": "日本研发出为下一代以太网技术奠定基础的新激光器", "keyword": "分布反馈激光器 电吸收调制器 脉冲幅度调制技术", "content_zh": "新激光器为下一代以太网技术奠定基础日本科学家开发了一种新型分布式反馈(DFB)激光器，并证明它可以在创纪录的10千米距离上以200 Gb/s的速度传输数据。 这项研究可能有助于推进网络技术，使互联网数据中心能够处理前所未有的数据。Lumentum日本数据通信业务部门的光学工程师Kazuki Nishimura将在2023年3月5日至9日在美国加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥举行的光纤通信会议(OFC)上介绍这项新研究...“这项研究有助于800G和1.6T以太网的下一代数据中心的发展。 特别是，新技术表明，集成分布式反馈（EA-DFB）激光器的电吸收调制器可以使用传统的PAM4（脉冲幅度调制）技术进行甚至10公里的传输，该技术被定义为一种简单的强度调制直接检测（IM/DD）方案，“西村说。随着通信流量的持续增加，人们越来越关注实现下一代以太网技术，如800G和1.6T以太网，以帮助数据中心满足日益增长的需求。 尽管目前400G以太网中用于2公里传输的PAM4技术正在考虑用于800G以太网，但为了实现数据中心区域或中心之间的互连，需要新的技术来实现更长距离的数据传输。在新的工作中，研究人员开发了集总电极电吸收(EA)调制器DFB激光器来实现更长距离的传输。 他们首先使用这种新型激光器，在50°C工作下，使用粗波分复用(CWDM)波段，演示了225-Gb/s PAM4的5公里传输。 他们还使用该激光器在1293.5nm处对225-Gb/s的PAM4进行了10千米的传输。 该波长比分配给CWDM的波长范围显示更少的色散，CWDM技术通常用于在光纤上同时发送多个光信号。 色散会导致光信号的退化，对于较长的传输距离来说问题更大。在所有的实验中，新激光器表现出较低的发射机和色散眼闭合四值(TDECQ)值，表明发射机性能良好。 研究人员说，他们的结果证明了集总电极EA-DFB激光器作为800G以太网技术光源的潜力，包括10公里的应用。 它也可以用于更长距离5公里的CWDM4应用。“随着高分辨率视频流服务，如4K和云应用，数据中心的流量每年都在显著增长。这些结果表明，我们的EA-DFBS是实现即将到来的800GbE应用的有希望的光学光源，”西村说。 ", "content_en": "New laser lays groundwork for next-generation ethernet technologyScientists from Japan have developed a new type of distributed feedback (DFB) laser and have shown that it can be used to transmit data at speeds of 200 Gb/s over a record distance of 10 kilometers.

Although the same PAM4 technology used for 2-km transmission in today's 400G ethernet is being considered for 800G, new technology is needed to achieve data transmission over longer distances for interconnections between data center regions or campuses.In the new work, the researchers developed a lumped electrode electro-absorption (EA) modulator DFB laser to achieve longer distances. They first used the new laser to demonstrate 5-km transmission of 225-Gb/s PAM4 using the coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) wavelength band under 50°C operation. They also used the laser for 10-km transmission of 225-Gb/s PAM4 at 1293.5 nm. This wavelength exhibits less chromatic dispersion than the wavelength range assigned to CWDM, the technology typically used to simultaneously send multiple optical signals over an optical fiber. Chromatic dispersion can cause degradation in the optical signal and is more problematic for longer transmission distances.For all the experiments, the new laser exhibited low transmitter and dispersion eye closure quaternary (TDECQ) values, indicating solid transmitter performance. The researchers say that their results demonstrate the potential of the lumped electrode EA-DFB laser as a light source for 800G ethernet technology, including 10-km applications.

University of Oregon chemists have found a way to make carbon-based molecules with a unique structural feature: interlocking rings.Like other nanomaterials, these linked-together molecules have interesting properties that can be \"tuned\" by changing their size and chemical makeup. That makes them potentially useful for an array of applications, such as specialized sensors and new kinds of electronics.\"It's a new topology for carbon nanomaterials, and we're finding new properties that we haven't been able to see before,\" said James May, a graduate student in chemistry professor Ramesh Jasti's lab and the first author on the paper. May and his colleagues report their findings in a paper published in Nature Chemistry.Though other labs have also synthesized various types of interlocking molecules, the Jasti lab's method allows carbon nanotube-like structures to be linked together. It will allow chemists to make many different variations on the structure and more fully explore the properties of the new materials.\"You can create structures you can't with other methods,\" Jasti said.For example, his team used the approach to make three interlocked rings, as well as a rod-like structure with multiple rings that can slide up and down. The advance grew out of Jasti's work on nanohoops, rings of carbon atoms that are a pared-back variation of long, skinny carbon nanotubes.\"Because we're able to make these circular structures at will, I started thinking, could you make things that just don't exist in nature?\" Jasti said. \"That's where this idea of interlocking rings came in.\"Finding a series of chemical reactions that could generate the complicated ring structures took a creative approach. Their solution hinges on adding a strategically placed metal atom to one ring. That metal kickstarts the chemical reaction to make the second ring, forcing it to happen inside the first ring.

By making nanoscale adjustments, scientists could enhance the material to do exactly what they want it to do.

Barry Sharpless, Ph.D., W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry at Scripps Research, and Yi Liu, Ph.D., Facility Director for Organic and Macromolecular Synthesis at LBNL's Molecular Foundry, a multidisciplinary facility for the scientific and technical investigation of new materials.The Sharpless and Wu labs recently synthesized many previously inaccessible polysulfates using the sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction, which was discovered in the Sharpless lab. SuFEx is part of a growing set of molecule-building methods known as click chemistry for their high efficiency and easy reaction requirements. Sharpless was awarded a share of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work on click chemistry methods.In investigations at Liu's lab at LBNL's Molecular Foundry, the researchers discovered that some of the new polysulfates have superior \"dielectric\" properties. Dielectric materials are electrical insulators in which positive and negative charges separate—storing energy, in effect—when the materials are exposed to electric fields. They are used in capacitors, transistors and other ubiquitous components of modern electronic circuits.Many of the dielectric materials in contemporary use are lightweight, flexible, plastic-like materials called polymers. The new polysulfates also are polymers, but have greatly improved properties compared to commercial dielectric polymers. The team found that capacitors made from one of the new polysulfates, when enhanced with a thin film of aluminum oxide, could discharge a high density of energy, while withstanding electric fields (more than 700 million volts per meter) and temperatures (150 degrees C) that would destroy the most widely used polymer film capacitors.The researchers noted that the heat sensitivity of standard polymer capacitors often necessitates expensive and cumbersome cooling measures in systems that use them—for example, in some electric car models. Thus, adoption of the new polysulfate dielectrics could lead to cheaper, simpler, more durable power systems in electric cars and many other applications, they say.\"I was very surprised at first, and still am—I think we all are. How can a classic force from the domain of physics, like the electric field force, be modulated by a thin chemical-polymer film in its path?

The material makes it possible to emulate the synapses of neurons and mimic, for the first time, the learning that occurs during deep sleep.Neuromorphic computing is a new computing paradigm in which the behavior of the brain is emulated by mimicking the main synaptic functions of neurons. Among these functions is neuronal plasticity: the ability to store information or forget it depending on the duration and repetition of the electrical impulses that stimulate neurons, a plasticity that would be linked to learning and memory.Among the materials that mimic neuron synapses, memresistive materials, ferroelectrics, phase change memory materials, topological insulators and, more recently, magneto-ionic materials stand out. In the latter, changes in the magnetic properties are induced by the displacement of ions within the material caused by the application of an electric field.In these materials it is well known how the magnetism is modulated when applying the electric field, but the evolution of magnetic properties when voltage is stopped (that is, the evolution after the stimulus) is difficult to control. This makes it complicated to emulate some brain-inspired functions, such as maintaining the efficiency of learning that takes place even while the brain is in a state of deep sleep (i.e., without external stimulation).This study, led by researchers from the UAB Department of Physics Jordi Sort and Enric Menéndez, in collaboration with the ALBA Synchrotron, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2) and the ICMAB, proposes a new way of controlling the evolution of magnetization both in the stimulated and in the post-stimulus states.The researchers have developed a material based on a thin layer of cobalt mononitride (CoN) where, by applying an electric field, the accumulation of N ions at the interface between the layer and a liquid electrolyte in which the layer has been placed can be controlled.\"The new material works with the movement of ions controlled by electrical voltage, in a manner analogous to our brain, and at speeds similar to those produced in neurons, of the order of milliseconds,\" explain ICREA research professor Jordi Sort and Serra Húnter Tenure-track Professor Enric Menéndez. \"We have developed an artificial synapse that in the future may be the basis of a new computing paradigm, alternative to the one used by current computers,\" Sort and Menéndez point out.By applying voltage pulses, it has been possible to emulate, in a controlled way, processes such as memory, information processing, information retrieval and, for the first time, the controlled updating of information without applied voltage. This control has been achieved by modifying the thickness of the cobalt mononitride layers (which determines the speed of the ions motion), and the frequency of the pulses.The arrangement of the material allows the magnetoionic properties to be controlled not only when the voltage is applied but also, for the first time, when the voltage is removed. Once the external voltage stimulus disappears, the magnetization of the system can be reduced or increased, depending on the thickness of the material and the protocol how the voltage has been previously applied.This new effect opens a whole range of opportunities for new neuromorphic computing functions. It offers a new logic function that allows, for example, the possibility of mimicking the neural learning that occurs after brain stimulation, when we sleep profoundly. This functionality cannot be emulated by any other type of existing neuromorphic materials.\"When the thickness of the cobalt mononitride layer is below 50 nanometers and with a voltage applied at a frequency greater than 100 cycles per second, we have managed to emulate an additional logic function: once the voltage is applied, the device can be programmed to learn or to forget, without the need for any additional input of energy, mimicking the synaptic functions that take place in the brain during deep sleep, when information processing can continue without applying any external signal,\" says Jordi Sort.", "abstract": "近日，西班牙巴塞罗那自治大学开发了一种磁性材料，能够模仿人类大脑存储信息的方式。这种材料可以模拟神经元的突触，并首次模拟人类深度睡眠时产生的学习状态。神经形态计算是一种新的计算范式，科学家们可以通过模仿神经元的主要突触功能来模拟大脑的行为。为了在控制受激和后刺激状态下控制磁化演化，研究人员开发了一种基于氮化钴CoN薄层的材料，通过施加电场，科学家们可以控制N离子在该层与放置该层的液体电解质之间的界面处的反应。这种新材料以类似于我们大脑的方式，通过电压控制的离子运动，其速度与神经元产生的速度相似，大约为毫秒。通过施加电压脉冲，可以以受控的方式模拟诸如存储器、信息处理、信息检索等过程，并且首次在没有施加电压的情况下对信息进行受控更新。这种控制是通过改变一氮化钴层的厚度（决定离子运动的速度）和脉冲的频率来实现的，材料的布置允许不仅在施加电压时而且在第一次移除电压时控制磁离子特性。一旦外部电压刺激消失，系统的磁化强度可以减小或增大。这一新效应为新的神经形态计算功能提供了很多新的可能，它提供了一种新的逻辑功能，例如，当我们深度睡眠时，可以模拟大脑刺激后发生的神经学习，这种功能无法被任何其他类型的现有神经形态材料模仿。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-material-mimics-brain.html"}, {"title": "加拿大开发了一种测量双面太阳能电池板产生的太阳能的新方法", "keyword": "双面太阳能电池板 表征方法 双面设备", "content_zh": "利用太阳能：新方法提高双面面板的读数渥太华大学光子学和可再生能源实验室开发了一种新的方法来测量双面太阳能电池板产生的太阳能，这种双面太阳能技术有望满足不断增长的全球能源需求。这项研究发表在《焦耳》杂志上，来自工程和科学学院的太阳实验室团队的研究提出了一种表征方法，通过考虑雪、草和土壤等地面覆盖物的外部影响，将改善室内双面电池板的测量。 这将提供一种在室内持续测试双面太阳能电池板性能的方法，准确地反映了太阳能电池板在室外的表现。到2050年，双面光伏预计将提供超过16%的全球能源需求，SunLab的方法将改进目前不区分地面覆盖物的国际设备测量标准。“我们提出的表征方法，缩放后辐照度方法，是一种改进的方法，用于室内测量和建模双面设备，代表室外环境条件，”主要作者、物理学博士艾琳·托尼塔（Erin Tonita）说 在卡琳·欣泽教授手下学习的学生，他的研究小组开发了利用太阳能的新方法。“将这种新方法纳入未来的双面标准，将为测试双面面板在地面条件下的性能提供一种一致的方法，包括雪、草和土壤，对应于全球变化的光照条件。”光伏是通过半导体材料（如硅）将太阳能转化为电能的研究。 在双面太阳能电池板中，半导体材料被楔入两片玻璃之间，以允许两边收集阳光，其中一面通常朝向太阳，另一面朝向地面。双面太阳能电池板在背面收集的额外光比传统太阳能电池板具有优势，制造商吹嘘与传统太阳能电池板相比，产量增加了30%。 双面太阳能电池板也比传统电池板更耐用，可以发电30年以上。托尼塔说：“将这种方法应用到此类电池板的国际标准中，可以使户外双面电池板性能的预测绝对值控制在2%以内。”他预计这种方法的好处包括：允许对现有和新兴的双面技术进行比较。通过地面覆盖物特定设计优化来提高性能。增加非传统市场的太阳能电池板部署。降低双面电池板部署的投资风险。改进双面电池板制造数据表。“随着可再生能源渗透率朝着净零世界的方向增长，这种方法尤其重要， “到2050年，双面光伏预计将贡献超过16%的全球能源供应，或每年约30，000瓦时，”欣泽说，他是太阳实验室的创始人，也是大学光子器件用于能源的研究主席，还是电气工程和计算机科学学院的教授。欣泽补充说：“这将扩展国际电化学委员会目前的双面太阳能电池板测量标准，能够准确比较双面电池板技术、特定应用优化和双面电池板功率额定值，”欣泽的太阳实验室研究人员与亚利桑那州立大学合作进行了这项研究。 ", "content_en": "Harnessing solar energy: New method improves readings of double-sided panelsA laboratory in photonics and renewable energy at the University of Ottawa has developed a new method for measuring the solar energy produced by bifacial solar panels, the double-sided solar technology which is expected to meet increased global energy demands moving forward.Published in the journal Joule, this study from the SUNLAB team in the Faculties of Engineering and Science proposes a characterization method that will improve the measurement of bifacial panels indoors by considering external effects of ground cover such as snow, grass and soil. This will provide a way to consistently test bifacial solar panel performance indoors that accurately represents how the panels will perform outdoors.With bifacial photovoltaics expected to provide over 16% of global energy demand by 2050, the SUNLAB's methodology will improve international device measurement standards which currently do not distinguish between ground cover.\"Our proposed characterization method, the scaled rear irradiance method, is an improved method for indoor-measuring and modeling of bifacial devices that is representative of outdoor environmental conditions,\" says Erin Tonita, lead author and a Physics Ph.D. student studying under Professor Karin Hinzer, whose research group develops new ways to harness the sun's energy.\"Incorporating this new method into future bifacial standards would provide a consistent methodology for testing bifacial panel performance under ground conditions including snow, grass, and soil, corresponding to globally varying illumination conditions.\"Photovoltaics is the study of converting solar energy into electricity through semiconducting materials, such as silicon.

However, as the devices get thinner so does the space for accommodating the internal working components. This has created an issue of improper heat dissipation in thin-film devices, since conventional heat sink materials are bulky and cannot be integrated into them. Thus, there is a need for thermal diffusion materials that are thin and flexible and can be implemented in thin-film devices for efficient heat dissipation.Currently, several substrate materials can act as heat diffusers as thin films, but most diffuse heat in the in-plane direction isotropically. This, in turn, could create thermal interference with neighboring components of a device.\"For a substrate on which multiple devices are mounted in high density, it is necessary to control the direction of thermal diffusion and find an effective heat removal path while thermally insulating between the devices. The development of substrate films with high anisotropy in in-plane thermal conductivity is, therefore, an important target,\" explains Junior Associate Professor Kojiro Uetani from Tokyo University of Science (TUS) in Japan, who researches advanced materials for thermal conductivity and formerly belonged to SANKEN (The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research), Osaka University.In a recent study published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, Dr. Uetani and his team, comprising Assistant Professor Shota Tsuneyasu from National Institute of Technology, Oita College, and Prof. Toshifumi Satoh from Tokyo Polytechnic University, both in Japan, reported a newly developed nanocomposite film made of cellulose nanofibers and carbon fiber-fillers that demonstrated excellent in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity.Many polymer composites with thermally conductive fillers have been proposed to enhance thermal conductivity. However, there are few reports on materials with particulate or plate-like fillers that exhibit thermal conductivity anisotropy, which is important to prevent thermal interference between adjacent devices. Fibrous fillers such as carbon fibers (CF), on the other hand, can provide in-plane anisotropy in two-dimensional materials due to their structural anisotropy.It is also important to select a matrix with high thermal conductivity. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) extracted from the mantle of ascidians has been reported to exhibit higher thermal conductivity (about 2.5 W/mK) than conventional polymers, making it suitable for use as a heat-dissipating material. As indicated by the ability to write with a pencil on paper, cellulose has a high affinity for carbon materials and is easy to combine with CF fillers. For example, hydrophobic CF cannot be dispersed in water by itself, but in the presence of CNF, it is easily dispersed in water. Accordingly, the team chose bio-based ascidian—sea squirt—derived CNFs as the matrix.For material synthesis, the team prepared an aqueous suspension of CFs and CNFs and then used a technique called liquid 3D patterning. The process resulted in a nanocomposite consisting of a cellulose matrix with uniaxially aligned carbon fibers. To test the thermal conductivity of the films, the team used laser-spot periodic heating radiation thermometry method.They found that the material showed a high in-plane thermal conductivity anisotropy of 433% along with conductivity of 7.8 W/mK in the aligned direction and 1.8 W/mK in the in-plane orthogonal direction. They also installed a powder electroluminescent (EL) device on a CF/CNF film to demonstrate the effective heat dissipation. In addition, the nanocomposite film could cool two closely placed pseudo heat sources without any thermal interference.Apart from the excellent thermal properties, another major advantage of the CF/CNF films is their recyclability. The researchers were able to extract the CFs by burning the cellulose matrix, allowing to be reused.

Sparse processing particle image velocimetry (SPPIV) optimizes conventional measurement ways, and has succeeded in calculating real-time, high-speed fluid flow.Details of the group's findings were published in the journal Experiments in Fluids on August 29, 2022.Measuring the velocity field of a fluid flow, such as air or water, allows for greater feedback and control. This is becoming important in the push to boost the performance and fuel-efficiency of aircraft.Particle image velocimetry (PIV) has traditionally been used to measure fluid velocity.PIV employs image correlation analysis to determine a fluid's movement. Whilst this provides two-dimensional data and renders installing sensors unnecessary, processing the large amounts of data is time-consuming, especially with images of high-speed airflow. Because of this, real-time measurements are impossible with PIV.Associate Professor Taku Nonomura from Tohoku University's Graduate School of Engineering and Research Fellow Kumi Nakai from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology's Research Institute for Energy Conservation have been leading a group to overcome PIV's shortfalls.SPPIV harnesses a low-dimensional mode and sensor position optimization technology. The low-dimensional mode narrows the complex phenomenon to broader features, weeding out nonessential information that convolutes data calculation. The sensor position optimization technology carefully selects the optimal observational points, instead of flooding systems like PIV does.Fabricating a wind tunnel experiment with a real-time, high-speed camera, the group demonstrated that real-time measurement is possible using SPPIV. They also witnessed the world's first real-time measurement of fluid flow at 2000 hertz.\"This technology is versatile, and expected to enable real-time measurement and control of fluid flow in various fields,\" said Nonomura. \"Thanks to the combination of a low-dimensional model and optimization—even for measurement methods involving tedious analysis—the amount of data analyzed is significantly reduced.\"", "abstract": "近日，由日本东北大学领导的研究团队研发出一种叫做稀疏处理粒子图像测速技术（SPPIV）的流体流速测量新方法，该方法大幅优化了传统测量方法，并已成功应用于实时、高速流体流动计算。传统用于测量流体流速的方法是粒子图像测速技术（PIV）。该方法采用图像相关分析来确定流体的运动状态。虽然该方法可提了二维数据，并且不用安装传感器，但是需要处理大量数据，十分耗时，尤其是对于高速气流图像用PIV方法进行实时测量是不可能的。在新研究中，研究人员利用新技术的低维模式和传感器位置优化技术克服PIV的不足。低维模式能从复杂现象中提取更为显著的特征，剔除使数据计算复杂化的不必要信息。传感器位置优化技术能够仔细选择最佳观测点，而不是像传统PIV那样过多占用系统资源。最终，研究团队利用该技术首次成功完成以2000赫兹实时测量流体流速的风洞实验。研究人员表示，该研究的技术用途是广泛的，将有望大幅提升各领域流体流速实时测量和控制技术能力。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-09-real-time-high-speed-airflow-faster-conventional.html"}, {"title": "美国在室温环境下开发出片上制备单光子的新技术", "keyword": "单光子二维材料 半导体材料 波导", "content_zh": "实验室开发新方法在芯片上产生单光子围绕量子的未来，各地的研究人员都在加班加点地寻找如何最好地解开超级定位、纠缠、隧道或其他准备好的黄金时段量子粒子的承诺，量子粒子同时出现在两种状态的能力可以在许多应用中极大地扩展功率和效率。然而，从发展的角度来看，今天的量子设备“大约是20世纪50年代的计算机”，也就是说，这是一个开始。 这是六年级博士Kamyar Parto的说法 加兰·穆迪加州大学圣巴巴拉实验室的学生，量子光子学专家，电气和计算机工程助理教授。帕托是发表在《纳米快报》杂志上的一篇论文的共同主要作者，该论文描述了一项关键进展：开发一种芯片上的“工厂”，用于产生稳定、快速的单光子流，这对实现基于光子的量子技术至关重要。帕托解释说，在计算机开发的早期阶段，“研究人员刚刚制造出晶体管，他们有了如何进行数字开关的想法，但平台有点弱。 不同的小组开发了不同的平台，最终，大家都汇聚在CMOS（互补金属氧化物半导体）上。 然后，我们围绕半导体发生了巨大的爆炸。“”量子技术也在类似的地方--我们有想法和感觉到我们可以用它做什么，有许多竞争平台，但还没有明确的赢家，“他继续说道。”你有超导量子比特、硅中的自旋量子比特、静电自旋量子比特和基于离子阱的量子计算机。 微软正试图做拓扑保护的量子比特，在穆迪实验室，我们正在研究量子光子学。“帕托预测，获胜的平台将是不同平台的组合，因为每个平台都很强大，但也有局限性。”例如，使用量子光子学传输信息非常容易，因为光喜欢移动，“他说。”然而，自旋量子比特使存储信息和在其上做一些本地‘东西’变得更容易，但你不能到处移动这些数据。 那么，我们为什么不尝试使用光子学来从存储数据更好的平台传输数据，然后一旦数据存在就再次转换成另一种格式呢？“量子比特，这些行为奇怪的量子技术驱动力，当然不同于经典比特，经典比特只能以零或一的单一状态存在。 量子比特可以同时为一和零。 帕托说，在光子学领域，单个光子既可以存在（状态一），也可以不存在（状态零）。这是因为单个光子构成了所谓的二能级系统，这意味着它可以存在于零态、一态或任何组合中，比如50%一和50%零，或者80%一和20%零。 这可以在喜怒无常的小组中例行地做。 挑战在于以非常高的效率产生和收集单光子，例如通过使用波导将它们路由在芯片上。 波导的作用正如它们的名字所暗示的那样，将光引导到它需要去的地方，就像电线引导电一样。帕托解释说，“如果我们把这些单光子放入许多不同的波导中--每个波导上有1000个单光子--我们在某种程度上编排光子如何沿着芯片上的波导传播，我们就可以进行量子计算。”虽然使用波导在芯片上路由光子相对简单，但隔离一个光子并不容易，建立一个快速有效地产生数十亿光子的系统要困难得多。 这篇新论文描述了一种利用一种特殊现象产生单光子的技术，其效率比以前高得多。“这项工作是关于放大这些单光子的产生，以便它们对实际应用有用，”帕托说。 “本文描述的突破是，我们现在可以在室温下以一种有助于CMOS（大规模生产过程）的方式可靠地产生单光子。”产生单光子的方法有多种，但帕托和他的同事们正在通过使用某些二维(2D)半导体材料中的缺陷来实现这一点，这些材料只有一个原子厚，本质上是去除一点材料来产生缺陷。帕托说：“如果你把光（由激光产生）照射到正确的缺陷上，材料会发出单光子。” 材料中的缺陷起着所谓的限速状态的作用，这使得它的行为就像一个工厂，一次一个地推出单个光子。 每三到五纳秒可能会产生一个光子，但研究人员还不确定这个速度，获得博士学位的帕托 关于工程这类缺陷的话题，他说目前的速度可能会慢得多。2D的一大优势 ", "content_en": "Lab develops new method for on-chip generation of single photonAs buzz grows ever louder over the future of quantum, researchers everywhere are working overtime to discover how best to unlock the promise of super-positioned, entangled, tunneling or otherwise ready-for-primetime quantum particles, the ability of which to occur in two states at once could vastly expand power and efficiency in many applications.Developmentally, however, quantum devices today are \"about where the computer was in the 1950s,\" which it is to say, the very beginning. That's according to Kamyar Parto, a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the UC Santa Barbara lab of Galan Moody, an expert in quantum photonics and an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.Parto is co-lead author of a paper published in the journal Nano Letters, describing a key advance: the development of a kind of on-chip \"factory\" for producing a steady, fast stream of single photons, essential to enabling photonic-based quantum technologies.In the early stages of computer development, Parto explains, \"Researchers had just made the transistor, and they had ideas for how to make a digital switch, but the platform was kind of weak. Different groups developed different platforms, and eventually, everyone converged on CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor). Then, we had the huge explosion around semiconductors.\"\"Quantum technology is in a similar place—we have the idea and a sense of what we could do with it, and there are many competing platforms, but no clear winner yet,\" he continues. \"You have superconducting qubits, spin qubits in silicon, electrostatic spin qubits and ion-trap-based quantum computers. Microsoft is trying to do topologically protected qubits, and in the Moody Lab, we're working on quantum photonics.\"Parto predicts that the winning platform will be a combination of different platforms, given that each is powerful but also has limitations. \"For instance, it's very easy to transfer information using quantum photonics, because light likes to move,\" he says.\"A spin qubit, however, makes it easier to store information and do some local 'stuff' on it, but you can't move that data around. So, why don't we try to use photonics to transfer the data from the platform that stores it better, and then transform it again to another format once it's there?\"Qubits, those strangely behaving drivers of quantum technologies, are, of course, different from classical bits, which can exist in only a single state of zero or one. Qubits can be both one and zero simultaneously. In the realm of photonics, Parto said, a single photon can be made both to exist (state one) and not to exist (state zero).That is because a single photon constitutes what is called a two-level system, meaning that it can exist in a zero state, a one state, or any combination, such as 50% one and 50% zero, or maybe 80% one and 20% zero. This can be done routinely in the Moody group. The challenge is to generate and collect single photons with very high efficiency, such as by routing them on a chip using waveguides. Waveguides do exactly what their name suggests, guiding the light where it needs to go, much as wires guide electricity.Parto explains, \"If we put these single photons into many different waveguides—a thousand single photons on each waveguide—and we sort of choreograph how the photons travel along the waveguides on the chip, we can do a quantum computation.\"While it is relatively simple to use waveguides to route photons on chip, isolating a single photon is not easy, and setting up a system that produces billions of them rapidly and efficiently is much harder. The new paper describes a technique that employs a peculiar phenomenon to generate single photons with an efficiency that is much greater than has been achieved previously.\"The work is about amplifying the generation of these single photons so that they become useful to actual applications,\" Parto says. \"The breakthrough described in this paper is that we can now generate the single photons reliably at room temperature in a way that lends itself to (the mass-production process of) CMOS.\"There are various ways to go about generating single photons, but Parto and his colleagues are doing it by using defects in certain two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials, which are only one atom thick, essentially removing a bit of the material to create a defect.\"If you shine light (generated by a laser) onto the right kind of defect, the material will respond by emitting single photons,\" Parto says. \"The defect in the material acts as what is called a rate-limiting state, which allows it to behave like a factory for pushing out single photons, one at a time.\" One photon might be produced as often as every three to five nanoseconds, but the researchers aren't yet sure of the rate, and Parto, who earned his Ph.D. on the topic of engineering such defects, says that the current rate could be much slower.A big advantage of 2D materials is that they lend themselves to having defects engineered into them at specific locations. Further, Parto says, \"The materials are so thin that you can pick them up and put them on any other material without being constrained by the lattice geometry of a 3D crystal material. That makes the 2D material very easy to integrate, a capability we show in this paper.\"To make a useful device, the defect on the 2D material must be placed in the waveguides with extreme precision. \"There is one point on the material that produces light from a defect,\" Parto notes, \"and we need to get that single photon into a waveguide.\"Researchers try to do that in a couple of ways, for instance, by putting the material on the waveguide and then looking for an existing single defect, but even if the defect is precisely aligned and in exactly the right position, the extraction efficiency will be only 20% to 30%. That is because the single defect can emit only at one specific rate, and some of the light is emitted at oblique angles, rather than directly along the path to the waveguide. The theoretical upper limit of that design is only 40%, but making a useful device for quantum-information applications requires 99.99% extraction efficiency.\"The light from a defect inherently shines everywhere, but we prefer that it shine into these waveguides,\" Parto explains. \"We have two choices. If you put waveguides on top of the defect, maybe ten to fifteen percent of the light would go into the waveguides. That's not enough. But there is a physics phenomenon, called the Purcell effect, that we can utilize to boost this efficiency and direct more of the light into the waveguide. You do that by placing the defect inside an optical cavity—in our case it's in the shape of a micro-ring resonator, which is one of the only cavities that allows you to couple light into and out of a waveguide.\"\"If the cavity is small enough,\" he added, \"it will squeeze out the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, and those fluctuations are what cause the spontaneous emission of photons from the defect into a mode of light. By squeezing that quantum fluctuation into a cavity of finite volume, the fluctuation over the defect is increased, causing it to emit light preferentially into the ring, where it accelerates and becomes brighter, thus increasing the extraction efficiency.\"In experiments using the micro-ring resonator that were done for this paper, the team achieved extraction efficiency of 46%, which is an order-of-magnitude increase over prior reports.\"We're really encouraged by these results, because single-photon emitters in 2D materials address some of the outstanding challenges facing other materials in terms of scalability and manufacturability,\" says Moody. \"In the near term, we'll explore using them for a few different applications in quantum communications, but in the long term, our goal is to continue to develop this platform for quantum computing and networking.\"To do that, the group needs to improve their efficiency to better than 99%, and achieving that will require higher-quality nitride resonator rings. \"To enhance efficiency, you need to smooth out the ring when you carve it out of the silicon nitride film,\" Parto explains. \"However, if the material itself is not fully crystalline, even if you try to smooth it at the atomic level, the surfaces could still look rough and sponge-like, causing the light to scatter off of them.\"While some groups achieve the highest-quality nitride by purchasing it from companies that grow it perfectly, Parto explains, \"We have to grow it ourselves, because we have to put the defect under the material, and also, we're using a special type of silicon nitride that minimizes the background light for single-photon applications, and the companies don't do that.\"Parto can grow his nitrides in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition oven in the cleanroom at UCSB, but because it is a heavily used shared facility, he is not able to customize some settings that would allow him to grow material of sufficient quality. The, plan, he says, is to use these results to apply for new grants that would make it possible \"to get our own tools and hire students to do this work.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国开发出一种可在室温环境下高效产生可靠单光子的新技术。研究人员利用二维材料的缺陷来发射单光子，这要求缺陷必须以极高的精度放置在波导中，研究人员在多次尝试中的单光子提取效率仅为40%，远低于量子技术应用需要的99.99% 提取效率。为此，研究人员使用了一种特殊的氮化硅材料，最大限度地减少产生单光子的干扰，达到提高效率的目的。该研究有利于基于单光子的量子技术研究，有望促进量子技术的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-lab-method-on-chip-generation-photon.html"}, {"title": "德国开发出新颖的非常规超导量子位", "keyword": "超导量子位 约瑟夫森结 单层颗粒状铝 超导体", "content_zh": "量子计算机的一种新的稳定态量子比特方法Squantum计算机可以更快地处理大量数据，因为它们并行执行许多计算步骤。 量子计算机的信息载体是量子比特。 量子比特不仅具有“0”和“1”的信息，而且还具有介于两者之间的值。 然而，困难在于产生足够小且可以快速切换的量子比特来执行量子计算。超导电路是一个非常有希望的选择。 超导体是一种材料，在极低的温度下没有电阻，因此传导电流没有任何损耗。 这对于保持量子比特的量子态和有效地连接它们是很重要的。格拉姆量子比特：超导和敏感试剂盒研究人员现在成功地开发了新颖的非常规超导量子比特。 “超导量子比特的核心是一个所谓的约瑟夫森结，用来存储量子信息。在这里，我们做了一个关键的修改，”KIT量子材料和技术研究所(IQMT)的Ioan M.Pop博士说。通常，超导量子比特的约瑟夫森结是通过一个薄的氧化物屏障隔开两层铝来获得的。 “对于我们的量子比特，我们使用单层粒状铝，一种由几纳米大小的铝颗粒制成的超导体，嵌入氧化物矩阵中，”波普说。 然后，材料在三维约瑟夫森结网络中的自结构。“令人着迷的是，我们的量子比特的所有性质都由一个只有20纳米的非常小的结主导。因此，它就像超导量子比特中微观材料缺陷的放大镜，并提供了一个有希望的改进选择，”IQMT的西蒙·古兹勒补充道。完全由粒状铝制成的量子比特该团队取得的进展是基于以前测试过的使用所谓氟离子量子比特的方法。 这一早期版本的部分由粒状铝制成，其他由传统铝组成。 现在，整个量子比特都是由粒状铝构成的。 “如果量子电路可以从金属膜上切割出来，这将为通过蚀刻工艺和量子比特的扩展应用提供全新的工业生产机会，例如在强磁场中，”基特物理学院的丹尼斯·里格尔说。该论文发表在《自然材料》杂志上。 ", "content_en": "A new qubit approach for more stable states for quantum computersQuantum computers can more rapidly process large amounts of data, because they carry out many computation steps in parallel.

However, the difficulty consists in producing qubits that are small enough and can be switched quickly enough to execute quantum calculations.Superconducting circuits are a very promising option.

Raman microscopy is a powerful non-invasive tool for performing complex chemical analysis of cells and tissues, and this technology development could help expand its usefulness in biomedical applications.\"Our high-throughput Raman spectral imaging can quickly image and analyze a large area without any sample pretreatment, which could make it useful for medical diagnoses and the tests used to screen for new drugs,\" said research team leader Katsumasa Fujita from Osaka University. \"The label-free, high-throughput multiplex chemical imaging and analysis enabled by the technique could also be used to enable new applications or overcome limitations of current methods.\"In the Optica Publishing Group journal Biomedical Optics Express, the researchers describe their new multiline illumination confocal Raman microscopy approach. It works by detecting separate regions of the sample in parallel, enabling fast Raman hyperspectral imaging. They show that the technique can acquire hyperspectral images of biological tissue with a field of view of 1380 x 800 pixels in about 11 minutes. This would require days to acquire with a traditional Raman microscope.\"We hope that high-throughput Raman imaging will eventually make it possible to perform medical diagnoses more efficiently and accurately while possibly enabling diagnoses that weren't possible before,\" said Fujita. \"Label-free molecular analysis with Raman imaging would also be useful for efficiently detecting drug response of cells, aiding in drug development.\"Capturing chemical information fasterRaman spectroscopy provides important insights into the chemical makeup of a sample by using light to excite molecular vibration. The resulting molecular vibrations create a type of chemical fingerprint that can be used to identify the sample's composition. Raman microscopy takes this one step further by obtaining very high-resolution spectral images, which are useful for imaging cells and tissues. However, due to the tradeoff between spectral resolution and imaging speed, Raman microscopy hasn't been practical for use in the clinic.The new multiline illumination approach builds upon a technique the research team previously developed known as line-illumination Raman microscopy. That approach was faster than conventional confocal Raman microscopy and enabled dynamic imaging of living cells but was still too slow for the large-area imaging often required for medical diagnosis and tissue analysis.\"To address this issue, we developed multiline illumination Raman microscopy, which acquires large-area images about 20 times faster than line-illumination Raman microscopy,\" said Fujita. \"With our new technique, the spectral pixel number—or resolution—and imaging speed can be adjusted, depending on the application. In the future, even faster imaging speed might be possible as cameras continue to be developed with more pixels.\"Assembling the systemThe team's new multiline-illumination Raman microscope irradiates about 20,000 points in a sample simultaneously with multiple line-shaped laser beams. The Raman scattering spectra generated from the irradiated positions are then recorded in a single exposure that contains the spatial information for the Raman spectra in the sample. Scanning the laser beams across the sample allows a two-dimensional hyperspectral Raman image to be reconstructed.To accomplish this, the researchers use a cylindrical lens array—an optical element composed of periodically aligned multiple cylindrical lenses—to generate multiple line-shaped laser beams from a single laser beam. They combined this with a spectrophotometer capable of acquiring 20,000 spectra at the same time. Optical filters were also important for avoiding cross talk among the spectra at the spectrophotometer detector.A high-sensitivity, low-noise CCD camera with a large number of pixels was also critical. \"This CCD camera allowed 20,000 Raman spectra to be distributed on the CCD chip and detected simultaneously,\" said Fujita. \"The custom-made spectrophotometer also played an important role by forming the 2D distribution of spectra on the camera without significant distortion.\"Testing performanceThe researchers used the new technique to acquire measurements from live cells and tissues to test its imaging performance and potential in biomedical applications.

With the increasing amount of connectivity in our daily lives, ST’s contribution to enhancing our interactions with vehicles brings welcome advances for automotive designers looking to add the latest features to their projects.In this article, we give a brief overview of the CCC, followed by an analysis of ST’s newly announced IC and its place in an automotive NFC ecosystem.The CCC’s Digital Key ProjectActing as the unifying force to bring about smartphone-to-car connectivity, the CCC consists of a diverse group of engineers and manufacturers hoping to enhance the interaction between phone and vehicle. The leading CCC project, the Digital Key, hopes to act as an open standard by which smart devices may interact with and control vehicles. The Digital Key project leverages near-field communication (NFC) technology to allow secure communication between smart devices and vehicles. NFC is perhaps most well-known thanks to its use as a contactless payment method, but its use cases extend much further. In an automotive setting, NFC combined with the Digital Key project offers designers the ability to add another convenient method of entering, starting, or even sharing access to vehicles.ST25R3920B: Certified for Digital KeysDesigned with car-door or center-console applications in mind, the ST25R3920B sports impressive specs for automotive engineers wanting to add additional phone connectivity to new vehicles. One of the most impressive new features is the upgraded active wave-shaping (AWS) system.Using the built-in AWS, the received signal can actively prevent under/overshoot or reduce signal transients, helping to ease the certification process and allowing for easier interoperability between digital-keys and smartphones without requiring extensive antenna tuning during development.In addition to AWS, the ST25R3920B supports dynamic power output (DPO) in order to enable a long connection range and provide a consistent experience within this range. The chip’s 1.6 W power output helps maximize the interaction range while the integrated DPO ensures that systems built using this chip can protect target devices and meet certification limits.Integrating Into the Broader NFC EcosystemThe specifications of the ST25R3920B make it a suitable candidate for many CCC Digital Key applications. The new IC may be integrated within the door handle of a vehicle along with an antenna and microcontroller for keyless entry using NFC tags or smartphones since the high dynamic output power helps compensate for loss and small antenna size, which are major limiting factors for systems integrated in door handles.Once inside the vehicle, the ST25R3920B may also be used for Digital Key applications such as keyless start or starting the vehicle via smartphone. After integration of the ST chip within the vehicle’s center console, communication with a smart-card or smartphone could allow for full vehicle startup without requiring a physical key.In addition, by coupling with a Qi wireless charger, the ST25R3920B can be used as a protection method for NFC-enabled cards, which may be destroyed after being subjected to the high power produced by Qi chargers. More information can be found in the ST25R3920B datasheet.The Phone-Car Integration TrendThe new product from ST is a positive step toward the development and adoption of the CCC’s Digital Key standard. Future cars leveraging the ST25R3920B may no longer require a physical key to enter and start and may instead rely solely upon the NFC information stored in a smartphone.The versatility of NFC not only allows a new, convenient vehicle-access solution, but opens the door for many other integrations between phone and car such as active safety measures to prevent distracted driving or real-time vehicle diagnostic reporting, all of which make the simple act of driving a more enjoyable experience.", "abstract": "近日，意大利的意法半导体(ST)公司发布了一款名为ST25R3920B的芯片，该芯片是首款通过NFC论坛认证的可用于汽车连接数字密钥应用的芯片，它可以加强手机和汽车之间的联系。ST25R3920B芯片中最主要的特点是内置升级的主动波形整形 (AWS)系统。该系统在接收到信号时可以主动防止信号瞬变，有助于简化认证过程，并且在开发过程中无需进行大量天线的调整，让数字键和智能手机之间拥有更强的互操作性。除此之外，ST25R3920B芯片还支持动态功率输出 (DPO)，以实现长连接范围的使用。该公司表示，ST25R3920B芯片作为可以让汽车在未来只需要依赖存储在智能手机中的NFC信息即可进入和开启，并且实现共享访问的权限。该芯片功能的研发不仅提供了一种新的、方便的车辆访问解决方案，而且为手机和汽车之间的许多其他集成打开了大门，例如防止分心驾驶的主动安全措施或实时车辆诊断报告等。", "link": "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/stmicroelectronics-rolls-out-nfc-chip-for-digital-car-key-systems/"}, {"title": "英国开发出新型太阳能采集材料", "keyword": "太阳能 硫化铋钠 纳米晶体 ", "content_zh": "无毒材料被发现是超强太阳能收集器，太阳能电池对绿色能源的转变至关重要。 它们不仅可以用于屋顶和太阳能农场，还可以为自动车辆提供动力，如飞机和卫星。 然而，光伏太阳能电池目前又重又大，这使得它们很难运输到离网的偏远地区，那里非常需要它们。在伦敦帝国理工学院领导的一项合作中，研究人员与来自剑桥、UCL、牛津、德国亥姆霍兹-兹托姆柏林和其他地方的研究人员一起，生产了可以吸收与传统硅太阳能电池相当水平的阳光的材料，但厚度低1万倍。这种材料是硫化铋钠(NaBis2)，以纳米晶体的形式生长，并从溶液中沉积，制成30纳米厚度的薄膜。 Nabis2由无毒元素组成，这些元素在地壳中足够丰富，可以用于商业用途。 例如，铋基化合物被用作焊料或非处方胃药中的无毒铅替代品。 剑桥大学的一名学生和共同第一作者评论说，他们“发现了一种比传统太阳能电池技术吸收光更强的材料，可以从墨水中打印出来。这项技术有潜力制造轻质太阳能电池，可以很容易地运输或用于航空航天应用。”无序和钠的好处对强光吸收的关键因素是无序的影响和钠的作用。NaBiS2中的钠和铋离子大小相似，这意味着它们不是占据不同的晶体位点（有序），而是占据相同的位点（无序）。 结果，晶体结构转变为岩石盐，类似于食盐。 然而，钠和铋在材料中的分布并不均匀，这些离子之间无序的均匀性对吸收强度有显著的影响，最近对AgBiS2的研究也发现了类似的影响，但NaBiS2的光吸收起点更强，更尖锐。 这是因为钠不像银，对半导体带隙周围的电子态没有贡献。 因此，有更高浓度的电子态可用于光吸收。Seán Kavanagh，共同第一作者和博士。 帝国理工学院材料系的阿隆·沃尔什教授和伦敦大学洛杉矶分校的大卫·斯坎伦教授的研究小组的学生评论说，“无序长期以来一直被视为太阳能电池的敌人。 众所周知，硅(Si)、碲化镉（CdTe）和砷化镓（GaAs）等传统太阳能材料具有杀伤效率，研究人员通常致力于不惜一切代价避免这种效率。 这项工作，以及我们和其他小组最近的其他研究，表明情况不一定如此。“”相反，如果我们能够理解和控制这种无序，它可以提供一个强大的工具来调节材料性能，并在广泛的应用中产生破纪录的性能，不仅仅是太阳能电池，还包括发光二极管和热电材料，例如。 这对材料研究来说是一个令人兴奋的前景。“放大一万亿分之一秒，研究人员还发现无序对材料中光生电荷的传输有显著而不寻常的影响。 这是用光谱技术和计算模型研究的，这些技术探测发生在万亿分之一秒（皮秒）的过程。这些研究发现，钠和铋离子的不均匀分布导致局域电子态的形成，这些电子态迅速捕获电荷。 这些电荷在这些状态下存活数十微秒，比在其他新型半导体中至少长100倍。 然而，电荷被困在这些态中，只能通过在态间跳跃来移动，这最终限制了它们移动和被提取为电性的能力。不同寻常的是，研究人员还发现原子缺陷在NaBiS2中扮演着可以忽略不计的角色，因为电荷的传输受这些局域态的影响。 因此，这些结果证明了控制无序程度和理解对材料中电子态的影响的重要性。研究人员还发现，NaBiS2在11个月的测试期间在空气中保持稳定，无需任何封装，这与其他新型光伏材料形成鲜明对比，如卤化铅钙钛矿。 这表明这种材料在器件中的长期耐久性，这是商业太阳能电池的关键要求。许多新的机会研究人员设想这些发现将引发人们对NaBiS2和类似材料的更大兴趣，尤其是在理解阳离子无序的作用以及电荷与晶格之间的相互作用方面。 罗伯特·霍耶，高级讲师 ", "content_en": "Nontoxic material found to be ultra-strong solar energy harvesterSolar cells are vital for the green energy transition. They can be used not only on rooftops and solar farms but also for powering autonomous vehicles, such as planes and satellites. However, photovoltaic solar cells are currently heavy and bulky, making them difficult to transport to remote locations off-grid, where they are much needed.In a collaboration led by Imperial College London, alongside researchers from Cambridge, UCL, Oxford, Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin in Germany, and others, researchers have produced materials that can absorb comparable levels of sunlight as conventional silicon solar cells, but with 10,000 times lower thickness.The material is sodium bismuth sulfide (NaBiS2), which is grown as nanocrystals and deposited from solution to make films 30 nanometers in thickness. NaBiS2 is comprised of nontoxic elements that are sufficiently abundant in the earth's crust for use commercially. For example, bismuth-based compounds are used as a nontoxic lead replacement in solder, or in over-the-counter stomach medicine.Yi-Teng Huang, Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge and co-first author, commented that they \"have found a material that absorbs light more strongly than conventional solar cell technologies and can be printed from an ink. This technology has potential for making lightweight solar cells which can be easily transported or used in aerospace applications.\"Benefits of disorder and sodiumCritical factors to the strong light absorption are the effects of disorder and the role of sodium.The sodium and bismuth ions in NaBiS2 have similar sizes, meaning that instead of occupying different crystallographic sites (ordered), they occupy the same site (disordered). As a result, the crystal structure changes to rocksalt, which resembles table salt. However, the sodium and bismuth are not uniformly distributed in the material, and this (in)homogeneity of disorder among these ions has a significant effect on absorption strength.Similar effects were found in recent work on AgBiS2, but NaBiS2 has a stronger and sharper onset in light absorption. This is because sodium, unlike silver, does not contribute to the electronic states around the bandgap of the semiconductor. As a result, there is a higher concentration of electronic states available for light absorption.Seán Kavanagh, co-first author and Ph.D. student in the research groups of Prof Aron Walsh in the Department of Materials at Imperial, and Prof David Scanlon at UCL, commented that \"disorder has long been seen as the enemy of solar cells. Known to kill efficiency in conventional solar materials like silicon (Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and gallium arsenide (GaAs), researchers have typically focused on avoiding it at all costs. This work, along with other recent studies from our and other groups, shows that this is not necessarily the case.\"\"Rather if we can understand and control this disorder, it can present a powerful tool to tune material properties and yield record-breaking performance in a wide range of applications, not just solar cells but also LEDs and thermoelectrics, for instance. It's an exciting prospect for materials research.\"Zooming in on a trillionth of a secondThe researchers also found that disorder has a significant and unusual effect on the transport of photogenerated charges in the material. This was studied using spectroscopic techniques that probe processes occurring down to a trillionth of a second (picosecond), as well as computational modeling.These studies found that an inhomogeneous distribution of sodium and bismuth ions results in localized electronic states forming, which rapidly capture charges. These charges live in these states for tens of microseconds, which is at least 100 times longer than in other novel semiconductors. However, the charges are trapped in these states and can only move by hopping between states, which ultimately limits their ability to move and be extracted as electricity.Unusually, researchers also found that atomic defects play a negligible role in NaBiS2, because the transport of charges is dominated by the effects of these localized states. These results, therefore, demonstrate the importance of controlling the degree of disorder and understanding the influence on the electronic states in materials.Researchers also found NaBiS2 to be stable in air for the entire duration of their 11-month test without any encapsulation required, which is in stark contrast to other novel photovoltaic materials, such as lead-halide perovskites.

These improvements may benefit noninvasive health monitoring, such as testing that involves saliva or sweat. The findings were published this month in Analytica Chimica Acta.The researchers developed a novel analytical platform that enabled them to selectively measure multiple biomolecules using a single sensor, saving space and reducing complexity as compared to the usual route of using multi-sensor systems.In particular, they showed that their sensor can simultaneously detect small quantities of uric acid and tyrosine—two important biomarkers associated with kidney and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, metabolic disorders, and neuropsychiatric and eating disorders—in sweat and saliva, making the developed method suitable for personalized health monitoring and intervention.Many biomarkers have similar molecular structures or overlapping electrochemical signatures, making it difficult to detect them simultaneously. Leveraging machine learning for measuring multiple biomarkers can improve the accuracy and reliability of diagnostics and as a result improve patient outcomes, according to the researchers.

With rising demand for faster and more intelligent computers and devices, there is a pressing need to develop alternatives to traditional electronic components that will make these devices more energy-efficient.In two recent studies, researchers at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), IISc, report the development of a highly energy-efficient computing platform that offers promise in building next-generation electronic devices.Instead of using complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) which are the building blocks of most electronic circuits today, the team used components called memristors that can both store data and perform computation. By designing unique memristors based on metal-organic complexes, the team could cut down the number of components needed in a circuit, greatly increasing the speed and efficiency.\"We have now discovered a molecular circuit element that can capture complex logic functions within itself, facilitating in-memory computations in a smaller number of time steps and using much fewer elements than usual,\" says Sreetosh Goswami, Assistant Professor at CeNSE who led both the studies published in Advanced Materials.Existing computing architectures process and store data at separate physical locations. The back-and-forth communication between two locations consumes the lion's share of the computing energy. \"We are resolving this problem by performing both computation and storage at the same physical location,\" he says.The platform \"outperforms\" current state-of-the-art technologies by orders of magnitude, adds Goswami. \"We are [now] able to make arrays of devices that are more robust, consistent and stable even compared to commercial technologies like flash memories.\"Previously developed memristor-based circuits also suffer from limitations in speed and have a greater chance of errors accumulating because they carry out operations sequentially. The design of the new platform reduces the number of operational steps, increasing speed and reducing error, the researchers say.The metal-organic complexes used to build their platform were designed by Sreebrata Goswami, Specialist Scientist at CeNSE. \"These [complexes] are like electron sponges that can take and give away electrons for billions of cycles without degradation,\" he says. By making small chemical modifications—adding or swapping out one or two ions in the complexes, for example—researchers might be able to adapt the same circuit for multiple functions.When they built circuits that carry out mathematical operations and compared them with a typical CMOS circuit, the team found that the new platform offered 47 times higher energy efficiency and 93 times faster operating speed, while only taking up 9% of the physical footprint.Moving forward, the team plans to connect the platform to a sensor—for example, a smartphone screen that senses touch—and study how efficiently the platform processes the data it collects. Santi Prasad Rath, a postdoctoral fellow at CeNSE who designed and fabricated the circuit along with Ph.D. student Deepak, adds, \"In an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, this computing technology can be extremely useful.\"Such efforts are critical because scientists believe that we are soon reaching the point where CMOS technology cannot be scaled up anymore in terms of efficiency or performance. \"This necessitates the invention of new nanoscale device constructs to enable Moore's Law over the next few decades,\" says Navakanta Bhat, Professor at CeNSE and an expert in CMOS technologies.\"The fact that an emerging molecular platform is outperforming a mature technology is quite significant.

In an exciting new development, scientists from the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research (SANKEN) at Osaka University have demonstrated that electricity may be obtainable from water with a high salt concentration, such as seawater. Some people think about \"osmosis\" as just a science term they were forced to learn in elementary school biology class. However, the spontaneous motion of dissolved ions or molecules through a semi-permeable membrane when there is a concentration difference between the two sides can be harnessed to generate electricity. And luckily for us, the oceans are filled with salty water, which may be used to help alleviate humanity's ever-growing demand for energy. However, in order to be practical, this membrane needs to be very thin and highly selective to allow ions—but not water molecules—to pass through.Now, a research team led by Osaka University has used conventional semiconductor processing technology to precisely control the structure and arrangement of nanopores in an ultrathin silicon membrane. Because these fabrication methods have been around for decades, the costs and design complexities were minimized. Moreover, the size and location of the pores could be precisely controlled. \"Whenever there is a non-equilibrium situation, such as two water tanks with different salt concentrations, there is often an opportunity to covert this thermodynamic energy into electricity,\" says first author Makusu Tsutsui.Using a single 20-nm-sized nanopore, the device reached a peak power efficiency of 400 kW/m2. However, the researchers found that adding too many nanopores to the membrane actually reduced the power that could be extracted. The optimal configuration of pores, 100-nm-sized nanopores arranged in a grid with a spacing of one micrometer, yielded an osmotic power density of 100 W/m2. This was an important step in understanding how to design nanopore devices for best power generation. \"Many other research groups are promising environmentally friendly 'green' energy, but we go one step further and propose 'blue' energy based on oceanwater that can be applied on an industrial scale,\" senior author Tomoji Kawai says.

Under the leadership of Jigang Wang, senior scientist from Ames Lab, the team developed a microscope that uses terahertz waves to collect data on material samples. The team then used their microscope to explore methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite, a material that could potentially replace silicon in solar cells.Richard Kim, a scientist from Ames Lab, explained the two features that make the new scanning probe microscope unique. First, the microscope uses the terahertz range of electromagnetic frequencies to collect data on materials. This range is far below the visible light spectrum, falling between the infrared and microwave frequencies. Secondly, the terahertz light is shined through a sharp metallic tip that enhances the microscope's capabilities toward nanometer length scales.\"Normally if you have a light wave, you cannot see things smaller than the wavelength of the light you're using. And for this terahertz light, the wavelength is about a millimeter, so it's quite large,\" explained Kim. \"But here we used this sharp metallic tip with an apex that is sharpened to a 20-nanometer radius curvature, and this acts as our antenna to see things smaller than the wavelength that we were using.\"Using this new microscope, the team investigated a perovskite material, MAPbI3, that has recently become of interest to scientists as an alternative to silicon in solar cells. Perovskites are a special type of semiconductor that transports an electric charge when it is exposed to visible light. The main challenge to using MAPbI3 in solar cells is that it degrades easily when exposed to elements like heat and moisture.According to Wang and Kim, the team expected MAPbI3 to behave like an insulator when they exposed it to the terahertz light. Since the data collected on a sample is a reading of how the light scatters when the material is exposed to the terahertz waves, they expected a consistent low-level of light-scatter throughout the material. What they found, however, was that there was a lot of variation in light scattering along the boundary between the grains.Kim explained that conductive materials, like metals, would have a high level of light scattering, while less conductive materials like insulators would not have as much. The wide variation of light scattering detected along the grain boundaries in MAPbI3 sheds light on the material's degradation problem.Over the course of a week, the team continued to collect data on the material, and data collected in that time showed the degradation process through changes in the levels of light scatterings. This information can be useful for improving and manipulating the material in the future.\"We believe that the present study demonstrates a powerful microscopy tool to visualize, understand and potentially mitigate grain boundary degradation, defect traps, and materials degradation,\" said Wang. \"Better understanding of these issues may enable developing highly efficient perovskite-based photovoltaic devices for many years to come.\"The samples of MAPbI3 were provided by the University of Toledo.

The study was published in the journal Nanoscale.Dr. Tali Ilovitsh says that their \"new technology makes it possible, in a relatively simple way, to inject nanobubbles into the bloodstream, which then congregate in the area of the cancerous tumor. After that, using a low-frequency ultrasound, we explode the nanobubbles, and thereby the tumor.\"The researchers explain that the prevalent method of cancer treatment today is surgical removal of the tumor in combination with complementary treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Therapeutic ultrasound to destroy the cancerous tumor is a non-invasive alternative to surgery.This method has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it allows for localized and focused treatment; the use of high-intensity ultrasound can produce thermal or mechanical effects by delivering powerful acoustic energy to a focal point with high spatial-temporal precision. This method has been used to effectively treat solid tumors deep within in the body. Moreover, it makes it possible to treat patients who are unfit for tumor resection surgery. The disadvantage, however, is that the heat and high intensity of the ultrasound waves may damage the tissues near the tumor.In the current study, Dr. Ilovitsh and her team sought to overcome this problem. In the experiment, which used an animal model, the researchers were able to destroy the tumor by injecting nanobubbles into the bloodstream (as opposed to what has been until now, which is the local injection of microbubbles into the tumor itself), in combination with low-frequency ultrasound waves, with minimal off-target effects.Dr. Ilovitsh says that \"The combination of nanobubbles and low frequency ultrasound waves provides a more specific targeting of the area of the tumor, and reduces off-target toxicity. Applying the low frequency to the nanobubbles causes their extreme swelling and explosion, even at low pressures. This makes it possible to perform the mechanical destruction of the tumors at low-pressure thresholds. Our method has the advantages of ultrasound, in that it is safe, cost-effective, and clinically available, and in addition, the use of nanobubbles facilitates the targeting of tumors because they can be observed with the help of ultrasound imaging.\"Dr. Ilovitsh adds that the use of low-frequency ultrasound also increases the depth of penetration, minimizes distortion and attenuation, and enlarges the focal point. \"This can help in the treatment of tumors that are located deep with the body, and in addition facilitate the treatment of larger tumor volumes. The experiment was conducted in a breast cancer tumor mouse model, but it is likely that the treatment will also be effective with other types of tumors, and in the future, also in humans.\"Keren Primor Cohen, CEO of Ramot, adds that \"Ramot—Tel Aviv University Tech Transfer Company, applied for several patents to protect this technology and its application. We believe in the commercial potential of this breakthrough technology in cancer treatment, and we are in contact with several leading companies in Israel and abroad to promote it.\"", "abstract": "近日，以色列特拉维夫大学研究团队研发出一项能有针对性摧毁癌症肿瘤的新技术。当今癌症治疗的流行方法是手术切除肿瘤，并结合化疗和免疫疗法等补充治疗。用于破坏癌性肿瘤的治疗性超声波是外科手术的非侵入性替代方案。然而，缺点是超声波的热量和高强度可能损伤肿瘤附近的组织。在这项新研究中，研究人员彻底解决了这一问题。他们将纳米气泡注射到血液中，然后使这些纳米气泡聚集在癌症肿瘤附近区域。之后，使用低频超声波诱发纳米气泡爆炸，使肿瘤破裂，最终达到治疗癌症的目的。研究人员表示，纳米气泡和低频超声波的结合为肿瘤区域提供了更清晰的靶向，减少了脱靶毒性。此外，低频超声波的使用也增加了穿透深度，最大限度减少了失真和衰减，并扩大了焦点，这不仅有助于治疗位于身体深处的癌症肿瘤，还有助于治疗体积较大的肿瘤。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-combination-ultrasound-nanobubbles-cancerous-tumors.html"}, {"title": "韩国实现对量子电池充电性的严格控制", "keyword": "量子电池 量子力学 电磁场 量子位 ", "content_zh": "新型稳定的量子电池可以可靠地将能量存储到电磁场中。量子计算机为解决经典计算机无法解决的计算问题提供了潜力。 例如，加拿大Xanadu公司最近声称，其量子计算机能够在36微秒内解决使用最先进的超级计算机需要9000年才能完成的计算任务。然而，量子技术需要能量来运行。 这一简单的考虑导致研究人员发展了量子电池的想法，量子电池是用作能量存储设备的量子力学系统。 最近，韩国基础科学研究所(IBS)复杂系统理论物理中心(PCS)的研究人员能够对量子电池的可能充电性能进行严格限制。具体地说，他们表明，与经典充电协议相比，收集量子电池可以大大提高充电速度。 这要归功于量子效应，它允许量子电池中的电池同时充电。尽管理论上取得了这些成就，但量子电池的实验实现仍然很少。 最近唯一值得注意的反例是利用两能级系统（与刚才介绍的量子比特非常相似）来存储能量，能量是由电磁场（激光）提供的。鉴于目前的情况，寻找新的、更容易获得的量子平台来用作量子电池显然是至关重要的。 出于这种动机，来自同一IBS PCS团队的研究人员与Giuliano Benenti（意大利Insubria大学）合作，最近决定重新审视一个过去被大量研究的量子力学系统：微脉塞。微脉塞是一种使用原子束将光子泵入腔体的系统。 简单地说，微脉泽可以被看作是上述量子电池实验模型的镜面结构：能量被存储到电磁场中，由一系列量子比特与电磁场依次相互作用而充电。IBS PCS的研究人员和他们的合作者表明，微脉泽具有可以作为量子电池的优良模型的特征。 当试图使用电磁场来储存能量时，一个主要的关注点是，从原理上讲，电磁场可以吸收大量的能量，可能远远超过所需的能量。 与一个简单的情况做一个类比，这将相当于一个手机电池，当插上电源时，它的电量会无限期地增加。 在这种情况下，忘记手机已经插上电源可能是极其危险的，因为没有停止充电的机制。幸运的是，该团队的数值结果表明，这种情况不可能发生在微型计算机上。 电磁场很快达到一个最终的构型（技术上称为稳态），其能量可以在建立微脉泽时先验地确定。 这种特性确保了对过度充电风险的保护。此外，研究人员表明，电磁场的最终配置处于纯状态，这意味着它不会带来充电期间使用的量子比特的记忆。 后一种性质在处理量子电池时尤为关键。 它保证了电池中储存的所有能量可以随时提取和使用，而不需要跟踪充电过程中使用的量子比特。最后，实验表明这些吸引人的特征是鲁棒的，并且不会通过改变本研究定义的特定参数来破坏这些特征。 在试图建造一个真正的量子电池时，这种特性显然很重要，因为建造过程中的缺陷是不可避免的。有趣的是，在一系列平行的论文中，Stefan Nimmrichter和他的合作者已经表明，量子效应可以使微脉泽的充电过程比经典充电更快。 也就是说，他们已经能够在微脉泽电池充电过程中显示出前面提到的量子优势，所有这些结果都表明微脉泽可以被认为是一个有希望的新平台，可以用来构建量子电池。 事实上，这些系统已经在实验中实现了很多年，这可能会极大地促进构建新的可访问的量子攻击原型。为此，IBS PCS的研究人员和朱利亚诺·贝内蒂目前正在与斯特凡·尼姆里希特及其合作者开始联合合作，进一步探索这些有希望的模型。 希望这项新的研究合作将最终能够基准和实验测试 ", "content_en": "New stable quantum batteries can reliably store energy into electromagnetic fieldsQuantum computers offer the potential to solve computational problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers. As an example, the Canadian company Xanadu recently claimed that its quantum computer has been able to solve, in just 36 microseconds, a computational task that would have required 9,000 years using state-of-the-art supercomputers.However, quantum technologies need energy to operate. This simple consideration has led researchers to develop the idea of quantum batteries, which are quantum mechanical systems used as energy storage devices. Recently, researchers at the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems (PCS) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), South Korea have been able to put tight constraints on the possible charging performance of a quantum battery.Specifically, they showed that a collection of quantum batteries can lead to an enormous improvement in charging speed compared to a classical charging protocol. This is thanks to quantum effects, which allow the cells in quantum batteries to be charged simultaneously.Despite these theoretical achievements, the experimental realizations of quantum batteries are still scarce. The only recent notable counter-example used a collection of two-level systems (very similar to the qubits just introduced) for energy storage purposes, with the energy being provided by an electromagnetic field (a laser).Given the current situation, it is clearly of uttermost importance to find new and more accessible quantum platforms which can be used as quantum batteries. With this motivation in mind, researchers from the same IBS PCS team, working in collaboration with Giuliano Benenti (University of Insubria, Italy), recently decided to revisit a quantum mechanical system that has been studied heavily in the past: the micromaser.Micromaser is a system where a beam of atoms is used to pump photons into a cavity. Put in simple terms, a micromaser can be thought of as a configuration specular to the experimental model of quantum battery mentioned above: the energy is stored into the electromagnetic field, which is charged by a stream of qubits sequentially interacting with it.The IBS PCS researchers and their collaborator showed that micromasers have features that allow them to serve as excellent models of quantum batteries. One of the main concerns when trying to use an electromagnetic field to store energy is that in principle, the electromagnetic field could absorb an enormous amount of energy, potentially much more than what is necessary. Making an analogy with a simple case, this would correspond to a phone battery that, when plugged, continues to increase its charge indefinitely. In such a scenario, forgetting that the phone is plugged in could be extremely risky, since there would be no mechanism to stop the charging.Luckily, the team's numerical results show that this cannot happen in micromasers. The electromagnetic field reaches quickly a final configuration (technically called a steady state), whose energy can be determined and decided a priori when building the micromaser. This property ensures protection from the risks of overcharging.In addition, the researchers showed that the final configuration of the electromagnetic field is in a pure state, which means that it brings no memory of the qubits that have been used during the charging. This latter property is particularly crucial when dealing with a quantum battery. It ensures that all the energy stored in the battery can be extracted and used whenever necessary, without the need of keeping track of the qubits used during the charging process.Finally, it was shown that these appealing features are robust and are not destroyed by changing the specific parameters defined in this study. This property is of clear importance when trying to build an actual quantum battery since imperfections in the building process are simply unavoidable.Interestingly, in a parallel series of papers, Stefan Nimmrichter and his collaborators have shown that quantum effects can make the charging process of the micromaser faster than classical charging. In other words, they have been able to show the presence of the previously mentioned quantum advantage during the charging of a micromaser battery.All these results suggest that micromaser could be considered as a promising new platform that can be used to build quantum batteries. The fact that these systems have been already implemented in experimental realizations for many years could give a serious boost in building new accessible prototypes of quantum batteries.To this end, the IBS PCS researchers and Giuliano Benenti are currently starting a joint collaboration with Stefan Nimmrichter and his collaborators, to further explore these promising models. The hope is that this new research collaboration will finally be able to benchmark and experimentally test the performances of micromaser-based quantum battery devices.The research was published in Quantum Science and Technology.", "abstract": "近日，韩国基础科学研究所的研究人员实现了对量子电池充电性的控制。量子计算机能够解决经典计算机无法解决的计算问题，然而对量子技术中使用的量子电池进行充电控制一直是一个非常棘手的问题。为此，研究人员开发出一种能够控制量子电池充电的量子力学系统micro maser。micro maser是一种用原子束将光子泵入空腔的系统。在这个系统中能量被储存在电磁场中，主要通过一串量子位序列与之相互作用而带电。这种充电技术不仅可以确保量子电池不会发生过度充电，而且它还能够确保存储在电池中的所有能量在任何需要的时候被提取和使用，而无需跟踪充电过程中使用的量子位。该研究成果将会极大推动新型量子电池模型的建立。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-08-stable-quantum-batteries-reliably-energy.html"}, {"title": "日本开发出制造柔性电子电路的新方法", "keyword": "阈值电压 聚合物膜 柔性电子电路", "content_zh": "下一代超柔性电子电路的简易制造柔性半导体是未来可穿戴电子技术的关键，但很难集成到复杂的架构中。 现在，在最近发表在《先进电子材料》上的一项研究中，来自日本的研究人员开发了一种为先进电路制造高质量软半导体的简单方法。现代集成电路技术依赖于被称为互补金属氧化物半导体(CMOS)电路的基本元件。 硅是大多数现代CMOS技术的半导体元件。 然而，由于未来的CMOS电路必须（例如）塑造成身体的形状或集成到衣服上，许多工作集中在开发软的、柔性的、基于聚合物的半导体上。要将这些半导体，尤其是流动电子的n型半导体集成到CMOS电路中，必须克服几个技术挑战。 例如，制备高质量的逐层结构--对CMOS器件功能很重要--往往相当缓慢和具有挑战性。 解决这些挑战是奈良科学技术研究所(NAIST)的研究人员试图解决的问题。“理想情况下，人们可以将聚合物薄膜沉积到液体基底上，以便于转移到任何其他基底上，”主要作者曼尼什·潘迪解释道。 “与传统的溶液处理相比，我们的策略对所产生的半导体薄膜的形态进行了优越的控制，这对电学性能至关重要。”这项工作基于单向浮动薄膜转移。 通过使用不溶解聚合物的液体基材，溶剂溶解的聚合物可以以形成一维浮动聚合物膜的方式滴加到基材上。 当溶剂蒸发时，聚合物分子的取向垂直于薄膜的长度方向。 这种分子形态优化了聚合物膜的电性能。 一旦薄膜固化，人们就可以很容易地将其转移到另一个衬底上--例如，进行逐层沉积。资深作者Masakazu Nakamura说：“我们制备了一种N沟道晶体管，几乎没有阈值电压，这对保持电源效率很重要。” “通过使用我们的方法，将n沟道和p沟道晶体管制备和集成到一个基于柔性半导体的器件中应该很简单。”这项工作成功地以廉价且易于复制的方式制备了一维聚合物基半导体薄膜。 NAIST研究人员的聚合物薄膜组装方法将有助于推进柔性电子的前景，并有助于在即将到来的可穿戴CMOS技术中找到硅的替代品。 ", "content_en": "Easy fabrication of next-generation, super-flexible electronic circuitsFlexible semiconductors are essential for future wearable electronics technologies, but have been difficult to integrate into complex architectures. Now, in a study recently published in Advanced Electronic Materials, researchers from Japan have developed a straightforward means of fabricating high-quality soft semiconductors for advanced electrical circuits.Modern integrated circuit technology depends on basic elements known as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. Silicon is the semiconductor component of most modern CMOS technology. However, because future CMOS circuits must (for example) mold to the shape of a body or integrate into clothing, much work has focused on developing soft, flexible, polymer-based semiconductors.Several technical challenges must be overcome to integrate such semiconductors, especially n-type ones which flows electrons, into CMOS circuits. For example, preparing high-quality, layer-by-layer structures—important for CMOS device functionality—tends to be rather slow and challenging. Solving these challenges is the problem that researchers from Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) sought to address.\"Ideally, one would be able to deposit polymer films onto liquid substrates for ease of transfer to any other substrate,\" explains Manish Pandey, lead author. \"Our strategy offers superior control over the resulting semiconductor film morphology, which is critical to the electrical properties, compared with conventional solution processing.\"This work is based on unidirectional floating film transfer. By using a liquid substrate that does not dissolve the polymer, a solvent-dissolved polymer can be added dropwise onto the substrate, in a manner that forms a one-dimensional floating polymer film. Upon evaporation of the solvent, the polymer molecules orient perpendicular to the length direction of the film. This molecular morphology optimizes the electrical properties of the polymer film. Once the film solidifies, one can easily transfer it onto another substrate—e.g., for layer-by-layer deposition.\"We prepared an n-channel transistor that exhibited nearly no threshold voltage, which is important for maintaining power efficiency,\" says Masakazu Nakamura, senior author. \"By using our approach, preparing and integrating n-channel as well as p-channel transistors into one devicebased on flexible semiconductors—should be straightforward.\"This work succeeded in preparing one-dimensional, polymer-based semiconductor films in an inexpensive manner that is straightforward to replicate.

In general, a micrometer thick epitaxial layer for InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are grown on more than hundred micrometer thick sapphire substrates at high temperature (> 1000 °C).An important point is that the inevitable use of the thick sapphire substrates has led to a lot of shortcomings such as the insulative property, low thermal conductivity, inflexibility, etc. Thus, the LED thin layers grown on the substrates lead to many challenges to develop device applications, especially micro-LED display.Although these drawbacks can be resolved by removing the substrates, it is challenging due to its strong interfacial fracture toughness with mixed covalent-ionic bonds. Our group's research has been dedicated to removing the substrates at large scale while maintaining the film quality for fabricating III-nitride membranes.Briefly, intermediate microcavity layers have been introduced to alleviate the interfacial fracture toughness, and the residual tensile-stressed Ni layers were engineered to achieve sufficient energy release rate to conveniently exfoliate the GaN-based layers from the interfaces. Based on this mechanical lift-off technique, we demonstrated large-scale undoped-GaN and green LED membranes and verified the quality by fabricating opto-electronic devices, such as ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors and vertical-type green LEDs after the large-scale exfoliation.The authors of this article introduce microcavity-assisted crack propagation to obtain large-scale and high-quality III-nitride membranes. Nanoporous structures have been fabricated to be used as a template to grow high-quality GaN-based layers such as undoped-GaN and green LEDs. During the high temperature overgrowth of the layers, the nanoporous structures were transformed into micro-size cavity structures.The key role for the micro-size cavity structures is primarily to alleviate the original interfacial toughness of GaN by reducing surface area. The reduced interfacial toughness, called the effective interfacial toughness, can be adjusted by modulating the surface porosity and the depth of nanoporous structures. Based on the overgrown target layers (undoped-GaN and green LEDs) with the effective interfacial toughness, we applied tensile-stressed Ni layers, callled a Ni stressor, to provide sufficient energy release rate. The target layers were easily exfoliated at the interfaces of microcavity structures by matching the energy release rate obtained from the Ni stressors, which is deposited by electroplating, to the effective interfacial toughness.After the large-scale exfoliation, the quality of the undoped-GaN membrane was verified by measuring rocking curves through X-ray diffraction.

Exposure to certain types of radiation present in orbit can damage the devices, degrading their performance and limiting their lifetime.In the Journal of Applied Physics, scientists from the University of Cambridge proposed a radiation-tolerant photovoltaic cell design that features an ultrathin layer of light-absorbing material.When solar cells absorb light, they transfer its energy to negatively charged electrons in the material. These charge carriers are knocked free and generate a flow of electricity across the photovoltaic. Irradiation in space causes damage and lowers efficiency by displacing atoms in the solar cell material and reducing the lifetime of the charge carriers. Making photovoltaics thinner should increase their longevity because the charge carriers have less far to go during their shortened lifetimes.As low Earth orbit becomes more cluttered with satellites, it becomes increasingly necessary to use middle Earth orbits, such as the Molniya orbit that passes through the center of Earth's proton radiation belt. Radiation-tolerant cell designs will be needed for these higher orbits.Another application for radiation-tolerant cells is the study of other planets and moons. For example, Europa, a moon of Jupiter, has one of the most severe radiation environments in the solar system. Landing a solar-powered spacecraft on Europa will require radiation-tolerant devices.The investigators built two types of photovoltaic devices using the semiconductor gallium arsenide. One was an on-chip design built by layering several substances in a stack. The other design involved a silver back mirror to enhance light absorption.To mimic the effects of radiation in space, the devices were bombarded with protons generated at the Dalton Cumbrian Nuclear Facility in the U.K. The performance of the photovoltaic devices before and after irradiation was studied using a technique known as cathodoluminescence that can give a measure of the amount of radiation damage. A second set of tests using a Compact Solar Simulator were carried out to determine how well the devices converted sunlight to power after being bombarded with protons.\"Our ultra-thin solar cell outperforms the previously studied, thicker devices for proton radiation above a certain threshold. The ultra-thin geometries offer favorable performance by two orders of magnitude relative to previous observations,\" said author Armin Barthel.The authors said that the improved performance of these ultra-thin cells is because the charge carriers live long enough to travel between terminals in the device.Compared to thicker cells, nearly 3.5 times less cover glass is needed for the ultra-thin cells to deliver the same amount of power after 20 years of operation.

The team's results were recently published in Results in Surfaces and Interfaces outlining how the high versality of Diamond's B18 beamline allowed them to perform X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy on their samples and compare the results with their predictive models.The researchers already have a patent for this material for arsenic decontamination and they hope that the new material might be incorporated into a filtration column for everyday use in affected households, as this cheap and efficient technology could improve the quality of water for millions of people. .First author of the publication, Dr. Jay Bullen explains, \"These experiments allowed us to directly investigate the structure of the surface complexes formed when arsenic binds to our TiO2/Fe2O3 nanomaterial. We were able to conclude that the surface complexes we had chosen for our predictive surface complexation model, using pure titania and pure iron oxide reference materials, were appropriate.\"\"However, we also saw some tridentate As-Fe2O3 bonding in the EXAFS data that wasn't included within our earlier model. We were also able to confirm surface precipitation of As(III) at low pH, which our model had predicted.\"Arsenic is a famously toxic element and long-term exposure to even trace amounts can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal diseases including skin cancer, lung cancer, keratosis, and neurological disorders. 100-200 million people globally are believed to be exposed to arsenic through contaminated groundwater drinking supplies. Water multi-step treatments to remove arsenic already exist, using filtration (adsorption), but this process requires pre-treatment (oxidation) to be efficient .Dr. Jay Bullen says, \"We wanted to better understand the nature of arsenic adsorbed onto this composite TiO2/Fe2O3 nanomaterial; to understand whether arsenic binds in the same way as onto pure TiO2 and pure Fe2O3 minerals.\"\"X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is the perfect way to do this, with EXAFS revealing information about the local environment of arsenic atoms, e.g. how many covalent bonds arsenic forms with the TiO2/Fe2O3 surface. The beamtime grant we received allowed us to realize these experiments at Diamond Lightsource.\"Spectroscopic observations to confirm a predictive modelArsenic can be found in several forms in water including arsenite and arsenate. Arsenite (i.e. As(III)) ions are difficult to remove from contaminated water using conventional treatments such as adsorption or coagulation-flocculation due to its neutral charge (H3AsO3). In contrast, arsenate (i.e. As(V)) ions (HAsO42- and H2AsO4-) are both (i) more easily adsorbed and (ii) less toxic than H3AsO3.Consequently, the treatment of As(III)-contaminated water benefits from the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) prior to its removal via adsorption. Oxidation of As(III) can be achieved using heterogeneous photocatalysts, such as TiO2, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, other materials such as iron oxides (Fe2O3) are more efficient for adsorption. Therefore multiple-step treatment plants are currently used but their design and maintainance is challenging.This difficulty may be overcome by incorporating photocatalytic and adsorption capabilities into a single material. Previous studies by the same group showed that composite materials combining the excellent photocatalytic capabilities of TiO2 with the high As(V) adsorption capacities of iron oxides (Fe2O3) were good candidates for efficient decontamination.The authors subsequently developed a surface complexation model (SCM) to predict changes in the amount of arsenic adsorbed and its speciation as a function of experimental variables such as pH.However, the authors wanted to verify that the structures of the adsorbed arsenic surface complexes chosen for the model were realistic, so they used spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy played a key role thanks to its element selectivity, its capability to discriminate As oxidation state (XANES) and to identify the structure of the As complexes adsorbed on the TiO2/Fe2O3 surface (EXAFS).The team used B18 to realize their experiments. At the beamline, they were able to record EXAFS spectra of solid samples to determine how many covalent bonds arsenic forms with the surface of the materials, and XANES spectra of aqueous suspensions to measure photooxidation kinetics.The authors combined spectroscopic data obtained at Diamond Lightsource (EXAFS) with FTIR and zeta potential measurements at Imperial College London to develop a picture of the dominant surface complexes formed when arsenic is adsorbed by TiO2/Fe2O3 composite nanomaterials.This was used to evaluate and verify the speciation of adsorbed arsenic predicted by the authors' previous Surface Complexation Model (SCM), a theoretical model that is able to predict changes in adsorption as a function of environmental conditions. This model had been developed using surface complexes chosen based on data for pure titania and pure iron oxides, with experimental evidence for arsenic speciation on composite TiO2/Fe2O3 not being available prior to the Diamond Lightsource study.", "abstract": "近日，英国伦敦帝国理工学院与英国钻石光源研究所使用基于二氧化钛和氧化铁的复合纳米材料来净化砷，并结合光催化、氧化和吸附原理，实现了对受污染废水的阶梯式处理。目前，已经存在的除砷多步废水处理方法，主要通过过滤（吸附作用）来实现，但该过程需要预处理（氧化）才能有效。研究人员通过X 射线吸收光谱来对传统方法进行了改进，开发出可用于净化砷的一步废水处理方法。其中，X射线吸收光谱的精细结构主要用于揭示砷原子的局部环境信息。在实验过程中，研究人员首先将废水中的亚砷酸盐（砷III）氧化为砷酸盐（砷V），这样可以使砷的毒性大大降低。然后，再通过将光催化和吸附能力结合到单一材料中来实现将砷从受污染废水中一步去除的目的。最后，研究人员还基于纯二氧化钛和纯氧化铁表面复合物数据，开发出可预测砷吸附量变化及其形态的表面络合物模型。该研究为净化废水中的砷提供了可靠有效的新方法，有望为复杂废水处理降低技术难度、节约成本。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-single-step-treatment-arsenic-decontamination.html"}, {"title": "沙特开发出可以保护微电网免受网络攻击的设备", "keyword": "太阳能控制器 电力网络 网络攻击 硬件性能计数器", "content_zh": "抵御微电网攻击的简单硬件与太阳能电池板控制器集成的廉价硬件可以保护孤立的电网免受网络攻击。小规模可再生能源系统的一个优势是，在需要时，它们可以被安排成独立于主电网运行的网络。 现在，KAUST的研究人员正在开发巧妙的方法来保护这些被称为微电网的网络免受网络攻击。“微电网是小的‘电力岛'，可以在紧急情况下为关键服务提供电力，如医疗保健、食物和水，”Ioannis Zografopoulos解释说，他与KAUST的Charalambos Konstantinou和美国达拉斯德克萨斯大学的同事一起进行了这项研究。然而，微电网的相对简单和孤立使它们成为旨在扰乱社区的网络攻击的诱人目标。在他们改善微电网安全的最新努力中， 该团队使用硬件性能计数器--嵌入大多数计算机中的特殊寄存器来监控事件，例如某个命令被执行了多少次。“HPC最初用于分析目的或识别代码中的瓶颈，”Zografopoulos说。 “然而，我们已经利用HPC来检测表明在我们的设备上执行恶意代码的代码模式：特别是太阳能逆变器的嵌入式控制器，该控制器将太阳能光伏板的输出转换为消费者可用的电力。”出于成本原因，太阳能逆变器的控制器没有配备HPC。 Zografopoulos和他的同事开发了量身定制的HPC，能够监控逆变器内发生的命令，而不会干扰他们将太阳能转化为电力的主要工作。 至关重要的是，该团队通过包括时间序列分类器，增加了一层额外的安全性； 这些算法将潜在的恶意命令组合与HPC触发事件的时间顺序相关联。“我们可以通过在一个定制的HPC上训练的分类器以超过97%的准确率检测逆变器控制器中的恶意软件，”Zografopoulos说。 “这满足了我们低成本、低复杂度防御对策的最初目标。”该团队还模拟了对加拿大城市配电系统副本的恶意软件攻击，该系统包含四个基于逆变器的分布式发电机。 他们的HPC系统能够检测可能导致设备损坏或电力中断的电压、电流和频率不稳定。“我们研究的主要收获是，嵌入式控制器可以配备基于硬件的恶意软件检测机制，不会增加复杂性或需要额外的计算资源，”Zografopoulos说。 “KAUST的设施使我们能够在实验室使用实际的逆变器控制器评估我们的方法，并模拟网络攻击的潜在影响。”这些发现发表在《能源报告》上。 ", "content_en": "Simple hardware to defend against microgrid attacksAn inexpensive piece of hardware integrated with solar panel controllers can protect isolated power networks from cyberattacks.One advantage of small-scale renewable energy systems is that they can be arranged into networks that operate independently of the main electric grid when required.

Zografopoulos and co-workers developed tailor-made HPCs that were able to monitor the commands occurring within the inverters, without interfering in their main job of converting solar energy to electricity. Crucially, the team added an extra layer of security by including time series classifiers; these are algorithms that correlate potentially malicious combinations of commands with the time sequence of HPC firing events.\"We can detect malware in inverter controllers with over 97 percent accuracy using a classifier trained on just a single custom-built HPC,\" says Zografopoulos. \"This meets our original objective for a low-cost and low-complexity defense countermeasure.\"The team also simulated malware attacks on a replica of the Canadian urban distribution system, containing four inverter-based distributed generators.

Recently published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, materials scientists from Drexel's College of Engineering, in partnership with a team at Accenture Labs, have reported a new design of a flexible wearable supercapacitor patch. It uses MXene, a material discovered at Drexel University in 2011, to create a textile-based supercapacitor that can charge in minutes and power an Arduino microcontroller temperature sensor and radio communication of data for almost two hours.\"This is a significant development for wearable technology,\" said Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished University and Bach professor in Drexel's College of Engineering, who co-authored the study. \"To fully integrate technology into fabric, we must also be able to seamlessly integrate its power source—our invention shows the path forward for textile energy storage devices.\"Co-authored along with Gogotsi's undergraduate and postdoctoral students, Genevieve Dion, professor and director of the Center for Functional Fabrics, and researchers from Accenture Labs in California, the study builds on previous research that looked at durability, electric conductivity and energy storage capacity of MXene-functionalized textiles that did not push to optimize the textile for powering electronics beyond passive devices such as LED lights. The latest work shows that not only can it withstand the rigors of being a textile, but it can also store and deliver enough power to run programmable electronics collecting and transmitting environmental data for hours—progress that could position it for use in health care technology.\"While there are many materials out there that can be integrated into textiles, MXene has a distinct advantage over other materials because of its natural conductivity and ability to disperse in water as a stable colloidal solution. This means textiles can easily be coated with MXene without using chemical additives—and additional production steps—to get the MXene to adhere to the fabric,\" said Tetiana Hryhorchuk, a doctoral researcher in Drexel's College of Engineering and co-author. \"As a result, our supercapacitor showed a high energy density and enabled functional applications such as powering programmable electronics, which is needed for implementing textile-based energy storage into the real-life applications.\"Drexel researchers have been exploring the possibility of adapting MXene, a conductive two-dimensional nanomaterial, as a coating that can imbue a wide range of materials with exceptional properties of conductivity, durability, impermeability to electromagnetic radiation, and energy storage.Recently, the team has looked at ways of using conductive MXene yarn to create textiles that sense and respond to temperature, movement and pressure. But to fully integrate these fabric devices as \"wearables\" the researchers also needed to find a way to weave a power source into the mix.\"Flexible, stretchable and truly textile-grade energy storing platforms have so far remained missing from most e-textile systems due to the insufficient performance metrics of current available materials and technologies,\" the research team wrote. \"Previous studies reported sufficient mechanical strength to withstand industrial knitting. However, the demonstrated application only included simple devices.\"The team set out to design its MXene textile supercapacitor patch with the goal of maximizing energy storage capacity while using a minimal amount of active material and taking up the smallest amount of space—to reduce the overall cost of production and preserve flexibility and wearability of the garment.To create the supercapacitor, the team simply dipped small swatches of woven cotton textile into a MXene solution and then layered on a lithium chloride electrolyte gel. Each supercapacitor cell consists of two layers of MXene-coated textile with an electrolyte separator also made of cotton textile. To make a patch with enough power to run some useful devices—Arduino programmable microcontrollers, in this case—the team stacked five cells to create a power pack capable of charging to 6 volts, the same amount as the larger rectangular batteries often used to power golf carts, electric lanterns, or for jump-starting vehicles.\"We came to the optimized configuration of a dip-coated, five-cell stack with an area of 25 square centimeters to produce the electrical loading necessary to power programmable devices,\" said Alex Inman, a doctoral researcher in the College of Engineering, and co-author of the paper. \"We also vacuum-sealed the cells to prevent degradation in performance. This packaging approach could be applicable to commercial products.\"The best-performing textile supercapacitor powered an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V microcontroller that was able to wirelessly transmit temperature every 30 seconds for 96 minutes.

Due to facile removal of as-generated hydrogen bubbles, the NF electrode modified with PEI hydrogel only outperformed those modified with expensive electrocatalysts especially at high current densities, according to the research team.\"We believe that our results can pave the way for the practical application of water electrolysis by providing insights into the design of electrodes and electrolyzers,\" noted the research team.This study has been published in Advanced Energy Materials.", "abstract": "近日，韩国蔚山国家科学技术研究所的研究人员使用超疏油性聚乙烯亚胺水凝胶通过促进气泡分离来改善电化学制氢。为了从电极表面去除气泡维持电化学气体释放反应，研究人员开发了一种在电极简单涂覆多孔聚合物水凝胶提高析氢反应效率的方法，该方法使用的水凝胶属于超厌氧聚合物，可以快速去除产生的气泡，不会影响目标基板赋予各种电极超疏水性。特别是在产生和粘附更多气泡的高电流密度下，用具有超疏油性的水凝胶修饰的电极比用电催化剂修饰的电极去除气泡效果更好。该过程不需要使用昂贵的电催化剂和复杂的工艺，就可以提高碱性析氢反应的电极性能。这一研究成果为电解水的实际应用铺平道路，为电极和电解槽的设计提供新的见解。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-10-superaerophobic-polyethyleneimine-hydrogels-electrochemical-hydrogen.html"}, {"title": "印度研发出有望增强量子通信和成像功能的再生光子纠缠技术", "keyword": "光子纠缠 量子通信 量子成像 自我恢复 角位置纠缠", "content_zh": "恢复的光子纠缠可以增强量子通信和成像印度的研究人员已经表明，当光子离开源传播时，在一定的连续变量基础上，光子纠缠会自我恢复。 这一发现可能有助于长距离安全传输量子信息和在湍流介质中进行量子成像。物理学家正在广泛探索光子之间的量子纠缠，通常旨在开发用于计算、通信、传感和成像的新量子技术。 一些潜在的应用要求在远距离或湍流环境中无损失地发送纠缠光子。 然而，目前在这种情况下保持某些类型的纠缠非常棘手--成功与否取决于许多因素，包括量子信息如何在光子中编码。现在，印度理工学院坎普尔量子光学和纠缠实验室的阿南德·贾和同事通过使用光子的角位置来编码信息，提供了一种可能的解决方案。 他们观察到，当光子传播时，纠缠似乎消失了，但后来奇怪地又出现了。 他们还表明，即使光子穿过湍流空气后，纠缠也会恢复，这通常会破坏纠缠。 他们在《科学进展》中描述了他们的研究。光子纠缠光子有许多不同的自由度，可以用来编码量子信息。 选择取决于必须编码的信息类型。 对于量子比特，可以使用光子的偏振或轨道角动量等离散性质。 但有时，尤其是为了传感和成像目的，以更连续的方式编码量子信息会更好。 在这类应用中，被探索最多的纠缠性质--或称为“基”--是由光子的笛卡尔坐标给出的光子位置。量子纠缠现象赋予粒子一种比经典物理学所允许的更密切的关系，并且与用来编码量子信息的特定基无关。 然而，在实验中使用或测量纠缠的方式可能不是基础独立的。 这适用于纠缠“见证”，它是决定系统是否纠缠的数学量。 对于连续基，见证子与基相关，这种依赖性意味着某些类型的连续纠缠比其他类型的纠缠更有用。对于位置-动量基，当光子离开源传播时，通过见证子看到的纠缠很快就消失了。 为了解决这个问题，科学家通常利用光子之间的纠缠来对源本身进行成像。 路径中的任何湍流也会迅速破坏纠缠，需要像自适应光学这样的复杂解决方案来恢复纠缠。 这些额外的校正步骤限制了这些纠缠光子的用途。Jha和同事的这项最新研究探索了如何通过使用一个密切相关的替代基础--光子的角位置--来保持纠缠。纠缠体的产生、丢失和恢复在他们的实验中，研究人员通过将高功率“泵浦”激光器的光发送到非线性晶体中来产生纠缠光子。 在光子能量和动量守恒的条件下，一个泵浦光子将产生两个纠缠光子，这一过程称为自发参量下转换(SPDC)。 这两个光子的所有性质都是纠缠在一起的。 例如，如果在一个位置探测到光子，则自动确定另一个纠缠光子的位置。 其他量也存在这种关联，如动量、角位置和轨道角动量。在没有任何纠正措施的情况下，研究人员观察到光子之间的位置纠缠在传播约4厘米后消失。 另一方面，角位置纠缠发生了一些有趣的事情。 它在传播约5厘米后消失，但在光子再传播20厘米后，纠缠又出现了（见图）。 研究人员用数值模型定性地证实了他们的实验结果。当团队在纠缠光子的路径上创造了一个湍流环境时，也观察到了同样的趋势。 这是用吹风加热器来搅动空气并改变其折射率。 在这种情况下，当光传播了更长的距离约45厘米后，纠缠又恢复了。目前还不完全知道是什么原因导致了角位置基上的纠缠再次出现。 基础是特殊的，因为它绕了一个完整的圈。 根据JHA的说法，这是它的区别因素之一。尽管这项研究证明了在小于一米的距离上的鲁棒性，JHA和他的同事声称T ", "content_en": "Revived photon entanglement could enhance quantum communication and imagingResearchers in India have shown that photon entanglement in a certain continuous-variable basis revives itself as the photons propagate away from their source. The discovery could prove useful for securely transmitting quantum information over long distances and for quantum imaging in turbulent media.Quantum entanglement between photons is being explored extensively by physicists, often with the aim of developing new quantum technologies for computing, communication, sensing and imaging. Some potential applications require sending entangled photons over long distances or through turbulent environments without loss. However, it is currently very tricky to preserve certain types of entanglement under these circumstances – and success can depend on many factors, including how the quantum information is encoded in the photons.Now Anand Jha and colleagues at the Quantum Optics and Entanglement Laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur have provided a possible solution by using the angular positions of photons to encode information. They observed that entanglement seems to disappear as the photons propagate, but then oddly reappears. They also showed that the revival of entanglement happens even after the photons travel through turbulent air, which would normally destroy entanglement. They describe their research in Science Advances.Photon entanglementPhotons have many different degrees of freedom that can be used to encode quantum information. The choice depends on the kind of information that has to be encoded. For qubits, discrete properties such as the polarization or the orbital angular momentum of a photon can be used. But sometimes, especially for sensing and imaging purposes, it is better to encode quantum information in a more continuous manner. In such applications, the most explored entangled property – or “basis” – is the position of a photon given by its cartesian coordinates.The phenomenon of quantum entanglement imparts to particles a closer relationship than is allowed by classical physics and is independent of which particular basis is used to encode quantum information. However, the way entanglement is used or measured in an experiment may not be basis independent. This applies to an entanglement “witness”, which is a mathematical quantity that determines whether a system is entangled. Witnesses are basis-dependent for continuous bases and this dependence means that some types of continuous entanglement can be more useful than others.For the position–momentum basis, the entanglement, as seen through the witness, dies out very quickly as the photons propagate away from their source. To get around this, scientists usually image the source itself to use entanglement between photons. Any turbulence in the path also rapidly destroys the entanglement, requiring complex solutions like adaptive optics to revive it. These additional corrective steps limit the utility of these entangled photons.This latest research by Jha and colleagues explores how entanglement can be preserved by using a closely related alternative basis – the angular position of a photon.Generating, losing, and reviving entanglementIn their experiment, the researchers generated entangled photons by sending light from a high-power “pump” laser into a nonlinear crystal. Under conditions where the photons’ energies and momenta are conserved, one pump photon will produce two entangled photons in a process called spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). The two photons are entangled in all their properties. If a photon is detected at one location, for example, the position of the other entangled photon is automatically determined. The correlation exists for other quantities as well, such as momentum, angular position and orbital angular momentum.As seen through the witness without any corrective measures, the researchers observed that position entanglement between photons disappears after about 4 cm of propagation. On the other hand, something interesting happens for angular-position entanglement. It disappears after about 5 cm of propagation, but after the photons have travelled another 20 cm, entanglement appears again (see figure). The researchers corroborated their experimental results qualitatively with a numerical model.The same trend was observed when the team created a turbulent environment in the path of the entangled photons. This was done using a blow heater to stir up air and change its refractive index. In this case entanglement was revived after the light had propagated for a longer distance of about 45 cm.It is not yet fully known what causes the entanglement in the angular-position basis to reappear. The basis is special because it wraps around after a full circle. That is one of its distinguishing factors, according to Jha.Even though the study demonstrates robustness over distances of less than a metre, Jha and colleagues claim that the revival is possible over kilometre distances as well. This could make it possible to transmit quantum information through atmospheric turbulence without destroying entanglement. Robustness through turbulence could also allow for the quantum imaging of objects in fuzzy biochemical environments with minimal invasion or destruction.", "abstract": "近日，由印度坎普尔理工学院领导的研究团队研发出一种可增强量子通信和量子成像功能的再生光子纠缠技术。该光子纠缠技术可以随光子传播在远离光源的位置自我恢复。物理学家正在广泛探索光子间量子纠缠，旨在开发用于计算、通信和成像的全新量子技术。一些潜在的应用领域需要通过湍流环境，长距离无损地发送纠缠光子。然而，目前保持某些特定类型的量子纠缠非常棘手，其中包括量子信息在光子中的编码。为此，研究人员提供了一种可行的解决方案，并使用光子角位置编码信息。研究人员观察到，随着光子的传播，纠缠似乎消失了，但随后又奇怪地重新出现。研究人员指出，即使在光子穿过通常会破坏量子纠缠的湍流空气后，纠缠也会再生。针对这种纠缠光子在传播约5厘米后消失，但在传播20厘米后又再次出现的现象。研究人员采用数字模型进行了模拟，并定性地证实了实验结果的科学性。目前研究人员仅证明了在不到一米的距离上光量子纠缠的鲁棒性，但研究人员表示，在一千米的距离上也有可能使光量子纠缠再生。该研究为未来复杂环境中量子信息的高效传输提供了理论依据。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/revived-photon-entanglement-could-enhance-quantum-communication-and-imaging/"}, {"title": "瑞士研发出一种高效节能的硅光子微电子机械系统", "keyword": "硅光子微电子机械系统 光子集成电路 微机电系统", "content_zh": "硅光子微机电系统向前迈进了一步近年来，全球数字化进程出现了前所未有的加速。 家庭办公室和远程学习环境中的视频流和视频会议导致了住宅宽带使用量的激增。 人工智能和自动驾驶汽车等新兴应用将进一步加速未来对数据通信的需求。 今天的因特网基础设施是建立在光纤通信基础上的，但是如何使光纤通信系统更有效地满足未来的数字通信需求呢？为了应对日益增长的数据速率，光纤通信系统使用许多专用波长的单独通信信道，这是一种称为波分复用的技术。 这些信道在通过光纤传输之前在多路复用器中被合并。 为了检索数据，在接收机侧对光学光谱进行解复用。 通常，这种操作是使用光子集成电路（PICs）来执行的。 PICS将光限制并引导到微尺度组件中，这些组件在多个波长通道中操纵信息，如阵列波导光栅或集成环形谐振器。在发表在《光学微系统杂志》上的一篇论文中，Hamed Sattari和合著者现在通过在光子集成电路中物理移动悬浮的硅环形谐振器来展示一种用于解复用操作的功率高效组件。 环形谐振器的机械位移允许将波长通道提取到总线波导中，有效地充当微机械操作的分插滤波器。 静电驱动机制建立在微机电系统(MEMS)上，微机电系统是一种广泛应用于消费电子产品中的技术，如用于视频投影仪的微镜。与现有的光学MEMS相比，本文展示的新型硅光子MEMS小了约3个数量级。 环形谐振腔的波导截面小于650nm×220nm，位移小于500nm就足以操作滤波器。 与现有的MEMS产品相比，这种紧凑的占地面积允许快速操作，静电驱动机制确保极低的功耗，使这种新的滤波器具有很高的能效。硅光子MEMS加载滤波器是在总部位于比利时的国际研发组织IMEC的标准硅光子平台上通过后处理实现的。 “在标准化铸造工艺中制造的硅光子学中集成MEMS代表了一个技术里程碑。我们证明光子MEMS可以与现有的高性能光子元件集成在片上，并可以大规模扩展，”尼尔斯·夸克说，他在瑞士EPFL（现就职于悉尼大学）领导光子MEMS开发活动。“我们的贡献表明硅光子MEMS在技术成熟方面向前迈出了重要的一步，”萨塔里说。 “现在可以构建由数千个组件组成的大规模光子集成电路，如分插滤波器，提供了一个缺失的平台，可以使数据中心和光纤通信应用更加节能。” ", "content_en": "Silicon photonic microelectromechanical systems take a step forwardIn recent years, global digitalization has seen unprecedented acceleration. Video streaming and video conferencing in home office and remote learning settings has resulted in a spike in residential broadband usage. Emerging applications such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles will further accelerate the need for data communication in the future. Today's internet infrastructure is built on fiber-optic communications, but how can the fiber-optic communication systems be made more efficient to fulfill future digital communication needs?To cope with the increasing data rates, fiber-optic communication systems use many individual communication channels at dedicated wavelengths, a technique known as wavelength division multiplexing. The channels are combined in a multiplexer before transmission over an optical fiber. To retrieve the data, the optical spectrum is de-multiplexed on the receiver side. Commonly, this operation is performed using photonic integrated circuits (PICs). PICs confine and guide light into microscale components that manipulate information in multiple wavelength channels, such as arrayed waveguide gratings or integrated ring resonators.In a paper published in the Journal of Optical Microsystems, Hamed Sattari and co-authors have now demonstrated a power-efficient component for the demultiplexing operation by physically moving a suspended silicon ring resonator in a photonic integrated circuit. The mechanical displacement of the ring resonator allows the extraction of a wavelength channel into a bus waveguide, effectively acting as a micro-mechanically operated add-drop filter. The electrostatic actuation mechanism builds on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), a technology widely implemented in consumer electronics, such as micromirrors for video projectors.Compared to these established optical MEMS, the novel silicon photonic MEMS demonstrated in the paper is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller. The waveguide cross-section of the ring resonator is less than 650 nm x 220 nm, and a displacement of less than 500 nm is sufficient to operate the filter. This compact footprint allows fast operation compared to established MEMS products, and the electrostatic actuation mechanism ensures an extremely low-power consumption, making this new filter highly energy efficient.The silicon photonic MEMS add-drop filter has been implemented by postprocessing on a standard silicon photonics platform from IMEC, an international research and development organization with headquarters in Belgium. \"The integration of MEMS in silicon photonics that has been manufactured in a standardized foundry process represents a technology milestone.

Many of these changes are mediated by specific genes and proteins, working in tandem with other cellular processes, but the specifics vary from cancer type to cancer type, and even from patient to patient.Sensitive tools for measuring protein or gene expression, even on the single cell level, have helped researchers understand the different cell types present in a tumor's microenvironment and how this composition changes after treatments. However, these assays don't necessarily show which proteins are active or relevant to tumor progression, or allow clinicians to noninvasively monitor the progress of the disease or its response to treatment. A protein could be present in a cancer cell as a bystander, for example, but not an active participant in its cellular transformations. Enzymes, which catalyze biochemical reactions inside cells, may give a clearer picture of which genes or proteins to target at a particular time.In work recently published in Nature Communications, researchers from the MIT Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research have developed a set of enzyme-targeting nanoscale tools to monitor cancer progression and treatment response in real time, map enzyme activity to precise locations within a tumor, and isolate relevant cell populations for analysis.\"We hope that this new suite of tools can be useful in the clinic and the lab alike,\" says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John J. and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, professor of electrical engineering the computer science, and senior author of the study. \"With further development, the nanosensors could be used by clinicians to tailor treatments to a patient's specific cancer, and to monitor cancer progression and treatment response, while researchers could use them to better understand the molecular biology of cancer and develop new tools to diagnose, track, and treat the disease.\"Bhatia is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. The study, conducted in collaboration with the laboratory of Tyler Jacks, was led by Ava Amini (Soleimany), a former graduate student from the Bhatia laboratory; and postdoc Jesse Kirkpatrick, also from the Bhatia lab.Tracking tumors in real timeFor several years, the Bhatia laboratory has been developing noninvasive urine tests for the detection of cancer, including colon, ovarian, and lung cancer. The tests rely on nanoparticles that interact with tumor proteins called proteases. Proteases are a type of enzyme that act as molecular scissors to cleave proteins and break them down into smaller components. Proteases help cancer cells escape from tumors by cutting through the extracellular network of proteins that holds cells in place.The nanoparticles are coated with peptides (short protein fragments) that target cancer-linked proteases. When the nanoparticles arrive at the tumor site, the peptides are cut and release biomarkers that can be detected in the urine.In the current study, the researchers tested whether they could use this technology not just to detect cancer, but to track the development of cancer and its response to treatments accurately and sensitively over time. The team created a panel of 14 nanoparticles designed to target proteases overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer induced in a mouse model. These nanoparticles had been adapted to release barcoded peptides when they encounter dysregulated enzymes in the tumor microenvironment.Each nanosensor was able to track different patterns of protease activity, which changed dramatically as the tumor progressed. After treatment with a lung cancer-targeting drug, the researchers were able to find signs tumor regression quickly, within just three days of administering treatment.Cell maps and populationsWhile the existing nanosensor technique could be used to track tumor progression and treatment response in general, by itself, it could not shed any light on the specific cellular process at work.\"Like many of the tools available to assess molecular markers for cancer, our urine reporter treats the body like a black box,\" says Kirkpatrick. \"While we get some information about the state of the disease, we wanted to know more about the cells or proteins that are causing the disease to behave in a particular way.\"Having identified nanosensors of interest, researchers mapped where in the tumor microenvironment the enzymes acting on these sensors were active. They adapted their nanoprobes to leave behind fluorescent tags when they are cleaved from the nanosensor, assigning different tags to different proteases. After applying the nanoprobes to samples of lung tissue, they looked for patterns in how the tags were distributed.One tag resulted in a curious spindle-like pattern that turned out to belong to the tumor vasculature. Researchers pinpointed the protease activity to specific types of cells: endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, and pericytes, which regulate vascular function and are actively recruited in angiogenesis—one of the archetypal hallmarks of cancer cell growth. Angiogenesis allows tumor cells to recruit existing blood vessels and stimulate new ones to form, in order to obtain the nutrients needed for tumor formation and progression.Using their nanoprobes to label and sort cells based on their enzymatic activity, the team identified populations of cells associated with vasculature that displayed heightened expression of genes related to angiogenesis. The researchers also found evidence of signaling between pericytes and the endothelial cells that together comprise angiogenic blood vessels in vascular tissue.Hallmark observationsIn future work, the team seeks to identify the specific protease active in pericytes and dissect its role in angiogenesis. With this knowledge, they hope to develop formulations of therapies that can be delivered to patients to disrupt the recruitment and formation of blood vessels associated with tumor growth.Ultimately, however, the team envisions panels of nanoprobes targeting several important features of cancer simultaneously and noninvasively in patients. Other hallmarks of cancer include proliferative signaling, the evasion of growth suppressors, genome instability, resistance to cell death, deregulated metabolism, and activation of invasion and metastasis. Because cancer alters protease activity across all of these processes, the team's nanoprobes could be designed to target these different processes, with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of tumor activity driving the disease. The approach could be used by researchers looking to investigate key biological phenomena in cancer models, as well as by clinicians seeking to monitor cancer progression noninvasively and select treatments for their patients.", "abstract": "近日，美国麻省理工学院开发了一套酶靶向纳米级工具，通过将酶活性精确映射到肿瘤内，分离相关细胞群进行分析，从而实时监测癌症进展和治疗反应。目前，研究人员对工具进行了测试，确定是否可以用来检测癌症，或者准确、灵敏地跟踪癌症发展及对治疗的反应。团队在研究中创建了一组14个纳米粒子，在靶向小鼠模型中诱导非小细胞肺癌中过度表达的蛋白酶。当这些纳米颗粒在肿瘤微环境中遇到失调酶时，会被调整为释放条形码肽。每个纳米传感器都能够跟踪不同模式的蛋白酶活性，随着肿瘤的进展，蛋白酶活性发生了巨大变化。在确定有用的纳米传感器后，研究人员绘制出在肿瘤微环境中作用于这些传感器的活跃酶的位置，从而改造纳米探针，给不同的蛋白酶进行标记。未来，团队试图识别周细胞中活性的特定蛋白酶，剖析其在血管生成中的作用。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-nanosensors-enzymes-cancer.html"}, {"title": "西班牙使用边缘计算技术创建可最大限度提高物联网传感器推理准确性的新算法", "keyword": "AMR?算法 边缘计算基础设施 物联网传感器", "content_zh": "研究人员使用边缘计算创建了一种算法，可以最大限度地提高物联网传感器的推理精度。我们正处于一个迷人的时代，即使是低资源设备，如物联网（IoT）传感器，也可以使用深度学习算法来解决复杂的问题，如图像分类或自然语言处理（人工智能的一个分支，旨在让计算机以与人类相同的方式理解口语和书面语）。然而，物联网传感器中的深度学习可能无法保证服务质量（QoS）要求，如推理精度和延迟。 随着数十亿物联网设备收集的数据呈指数级增长，需要转向分布式模型，在这种模型中，一些计算发生在网络边缘（边缘计算），更靠近数据创建的地方，而不是将其发送到云中进行处理和存储。IMDEA网络研究人员安德里亚·弗雷萨（Andrea Fresa） 学生）和Jaya Prakash Champati（研究助理教授）进行了一项研究，他们在研究中提出了算法AMR？，该算法利用边缘计算基础设施（处理、分析和存储更接近生成位置的数据，以实现更快、接近实时的分析和响应），在观察延迟限制的同时提高物联网传感器推断的准确性，并表明问题已经解决。 本周在Mswim会议上发表了一篇题为“边缘智能系统中边缘设备上最大化推理精度的卸载算法”的论文。为了理解推理是什么，我们必须首先解释机器学习工作在两个主要阶段。 第一个是指培训，当开发人员向他们的模型提供一组经过整理的数据时，这样它就可以“学习”它需要知道的关于它将要分析的数据类型的一切。 下一个阶段是推断：该模型可以根据真实数据进行预测，以产生可操作的结果。在他们的出版物中，研究人员得出结论，当比较AMR时，推断的准确性提高了40%？ 具有基本调度技术的算法。 他们还发现，有效的调度算法对于正确支持网络边缘的机器学习算法至关重要。“我们的研究结果可能对需要在终端设备上进行快速准确推理的机器学习(ML)应用极其有用。 例如，想想像Google Photos这样的服务，它对图像元素进行分类。 我们可以用AMR保证执行延迟吗？ 算法，对于开发人员来说，这可能是非常富有成效的，他们可以在设计中使用它来确保用户看不到延迟，“安德里亚·弗雷泽解释说。他们在进行这项研究时遇到的主要障碍是演示AMR的理论性能？ 算法，并用Raspberry PI和通过局域网连接的服务器组成的实验台对其进行了验证。 “为了证明AMR的性能极限？，我们使用了线性规划的基本思想和运筹学的工具，”弗雷泽强调说。然而，通过这项工作，IMDEA网络研究人员为未来的研究奠定了基础，这将有助于在网络边缘快速准确地运行机器学习(ML)应用程序。 ", "content_en": "Researchers create an algorithm that maximizes IoT sensor inference accuracy using edge computingWe are in a fascinating era where even low-resource devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, can use deep learning algorithms to tackle complex problems such as image classification or natural language processing (the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with giving computers the ability to understand spoken and written language in the same way as humans).However, deep learning in IoT sensors may not be able to guarantee quality of service (QoS) requirements such as inference accuracy and latency. With the exponential growth of data collected by billions of IoT devices, the need has arisen to shift to a distributed model in which some of the computing occurs at the edge of the network (edge computing), closer to where the data is created, rather than sending it to the cloud for processing and storage.IMDEA Networks researchers Andrea Fresa (Ph.D. Student) and Jaya Prakash Champati (Research Assistant Professor) have conducted a study in which they have presented the algorithm AMR?, which makes use of edge computing infrastructure (processing, analyzing, and storing data closer to where it is generated to enable faster, near real-time analysis and responses) to increase IoT sensor inference accuracy while observing latency constraints and have shown that the problem is solved.

Training and implementing most of these models, however, still requires vast amounts of energy and computational power.Engineers worldwide have thus been trying to develop alternative hardware solutions that can run artificial intelligence models more efficiently, as this could promote their widespread use and increase their sustainability. Some of these solutions are based on memristors, memory devices that can store information without consuming energy.Researchers at Université Paris-Saclay- CNRS, Université Grenoble-Alpes-CEA-LETI, HawAI.tech, Sorbonne Université, and Aix-Marseille Université-CNRS have recently created a so-called Bayesian machine (i.e., an AI approach that performs computations based on Bayes' theorem), using memristors. Their proposed system, introduced in a paper published in Nature Electronics, was found to be significantly more energy-efficient than currently employed hardware solutions.\"Artificial intelligence is making major progress today but faces a challenge: its considerable energy consumption,\" Damien Querlioz, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. \"It is now well understood that this consumption comes from the separation, in computers, between computation and memory functions. As artificial intelligence uses a lot of data, it requires a lot of memory, which is costly to access in terms of energy. Our brains are much more energy efficient because the memory functions are integrated as close as possible to the computation functions, and we wanted to reproduce this strategy.\"Memristors are essentially electrical components based on nanodevices that limit or regulate the flow of electrical current in a circuit, while also recording how much energy passed in it beforehand. As they perform both computations and information storage, these devices can better reproduce the human brain's information processing strategies.\"Until recently, memristors were an emerging technology, and we could not realize complete systems with them,\" Querlioz explained. \"Now, our team built a 'Bayesian machine,' a small artificial intelligence with memristors. The prototype comprises 2,048 hafnium oxide memristors and 30,080 silicon transistors (MOSFETs).\"The Bayesian machine created by Querlioz and his colleagues integrates memristors with conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The researchers created a prototype of the machine and assessed its performance on a gesture recognition task. Remarkably, they found that it could recognize specific human gestures using thousands of times less energy than a traditional hardware solution based on a microcontroller.\"Most of the research on memristor-based machine learning aims at implementing deep learning,\" Querlioz said. \"This is, of course, an extremely important goal, as deep learning is so successful today. However, deep learning has some limitations: its results are not explainable, and it does not perform well when little data is available. Here, we chose to implement Bayesian reasoning, an alternative AI approach that does not do well in big data applications where deep learning works so well, but excels in small data situations, and provides fully explainable results.\"In the future, the memristor-based Bayesian machine created by this team of researchers could help to increase the energy-efficiency of AI models, while also potentially inspiring the development of other similar solutions. It could be particularly useful for safety-critical applications, such as medical sensors or circuits to monitor the safety of industrial facilities. Hawai.tech, a start-up that contributed to the development of the team's Bayesian algorithm, is now using the machine to create these sensors.\"We have designed a considerably scaled-up version of the Bayesian machine, which is currently being fabricated, and we have applied the principles behind the machine to other machine learning approaches as well,\" Querlioz added. \"As we are scaling our designs in complexity, we are starting to hit the limits of what is possible for an academic group. So, we are simultaneously working on new technologies, the next memristors.\"", "abstract": "近日，法国多所高校的研究人员合作开发出一种基于忆阻器的贝叶斯推理电路，可基于贝叶斯定理进行人工智能运算。忆阻器是一种被动电子元件，可以限制或调节电路中的电流，且在断电后仍可以记忆此前通过的电荷量。由于忆阻器可以同时执行计算和存储信息，因此可以更好地再现人脑的信息处理策略。法国研究人员开发的贝叶斯推理电路由2048个氧化铪忆阻器和30080个硅晶体管构成。通过将忆阻器与传统的互补金属氧化物半导体技术相结合，研究人员研发出机器原型并评估了其识别手势的潜力。研究结果显示，与基于微控制器的传统硬件解决方案相比，它所消耗的能量最多可以减少数千倍。该推理电路的功能之一是迅速识别特定的人类手势，可能在工业设施监控、医疗监测等场景具有应用潜力。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-bayesian-machine-based-memristors.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出直接在内存中运行的芯片", "keyword": "NeuRRAM芯片 人工智能 内存计算", "content_zh": "用于边缘人工智能的新神经形态芯片，其能量和大小仅为当今计算平台的一小部分。国际研究团队设计并构建了一种芯片，可以直接在内存中运行计算，并可以运行各种各样的人工智能应用程序--所有这些都是用于通用人工智能计算的计算平台消耗的能量的一小部分。Neurram神经形态芯片使人工智能离在广泛的边缘设备上运行又近了一步，与云断开了连接， 在那里，他们可以随时随地执行复杂的认知任务，而不依赖于与集中服务器的网络连接。 应用遍布世界的每个角落和我们生活的每个方面，从智能手表到VR耳机、智能耳塞、工厂中的智能传感器和太空探索的漫游车。Neurram芯片不仅是最先进的“内存中计算”芯片的两倍节能，这是一种创新的混合芯片，在内存中运行计算，它还提供了与传统数字芯片一样准确的结果。 传统的人工智能平台体积要大得多，通常受限于使用在云中运行的大型数据服务器。此外，Neurram芯片具有高度的通用性，支持许多不同的神经网络模型和架构。 因此，该芯片可以用于许多不同的应用，包括图像识别和重建以及语音识别。“传统的观点是，内存计算的更高效率是以通用性为代价的，但我们的神经芯片在不牺牲通用性的情况下获得了效率，”该论文的第一作者、最近的博士韦尔·万（Weier Wan）说。 斯坦福大学毕业生，在加州大学圣地亚哥分校从事芯片工作，在那里他由生物工程系的格特·考文伯格共同建议。该研究小组由加州大学圣地亚哥分校的生物工程师共同领导，在8月17日的《自然》杂志上发表了他们的结果。目前，人工智能计算既耗电又昂贵。 边缘设备上的大多数人工智能应用都涉及将数据从设备转移到云中，在云中人工智能对其进行处理和分析。 然后将结果移回设备。 这是因为大多数边缘设备都是电池供电的，因此只有有限的功率可以专用于计算。通过降低边缘人工智能推理所需的功耗，这款神经芯片可以导致更强大、更智能、更易访问的边缘设备和更智能的制造。 这也可能导致更好的数据隐私，因为数据从设备到云的传输伴随着更大的安全风险。在人工智能芯片上，将数据从内存转移到计算单元是一个主要瓶颈。“这相当于在两个小时的工作日中进行八个小时的通勤，”万说。为了解决这个数据传输问题，研究人员使用了被称为电阻随机存取内存的非易失性内存，允许直接在内存中而不是在单独的计算单元中进行计算。 RRAM和其他用于神经形态计算的突触阵列的新兴存储器技术是在Philip Wong的实验室首创的，他是Wan在斯坦福大学的顾问，也是这项工作的主要贡献者。 使用RRAM芯片进行计算并不一定是新的，但通常会导致芯片上执行的计算精度下降，芯片架构缺乏灵活性。“自30多年前引入以来，内存计算一直是神经形态工程中的常见做法，”考文伯格斯说。 “Neurram的新之处在于，对于不同的人工智能应用来说，极端的效率现在与巨大的灵活性结合在一起，与标准的数字通用计算平台相比，准确性几乎没有损失。”一种精心制作的方法是这项工作的关键，它在硬件和软件的抽象层进行了多层次的“共同优化”，从芯片的设计到运行各种人工智能任务的配置。 此外，该团队确保考虑到从存储设备物理到电路和网络架构的各种限制。圣母大学计算机科学和工程助理教授西达特·乔希（Siddharth Joshi）说：“这种芯片现在为我们提供了一个平台，可以解决从设备和电路到算法的堆栈中的这些问题。”他作为博士开始参与该项目 加州大学圣地亚哥分校考文伯格实验室的学生和博士后研究员。芯片性能研究人员通过一种称为能量延迟积或EDP的测量方法来测量芯片的能效。 EDP综合了每次操作所消耗的能量和完成该操作所需的时间。 通过该方法，该神经芯片的EDP比现有技术低1.6至2.3倍（越低越好），计算密度高7至13倍 ", "content_en": "New neuromorphic chip for AI on the edge, at a small fraction of the energy and size of today's computing platformsAn international team of researchers has designed and built a chip that runs computations directly in memory and can run a wide variety of AI applications–all at a fraction of the energy consumed by computing platforms for general-purpose AI computing.The NeuRRAM neuromorphic chip brings AI a step closer to running on a broad range of edge devices, disconnected from the cloud, where they can perform sophisticated cognitive tasks anywhere and anytime without relying on a network connection to a centralized server. Applications abound in every corner of the world and every facet of our lives, and range from smart watches, to VR headsets, smart earbuds, smart sensors in factories and rovers for space exploration.The NeuRRAM chip is not only twice as energy efficient as the state-of-the-art \"compute-in-memory\" chips, an innovative class of hybrid chips that runs computations in memory, it also delivers results that are just as accurate as conventional digital chips. Conventional AI platforms are a lot bulkier and typically are constrained to using large data servers operating in the cloud.In addition, the NeuRRAM chip is highly versatile and supports many different neural network models and architectures. As a result, the chip can be used for many different applications, including image recognition and reconstruction as well as voice recognition.\"The conventional wisdom is that the higher efficiency of compute-in-memory is at the cost of versatility, but our NeuRRAM chip obtains efficiency while not sacrificing versatility,\" said Weier Wan, the paper's first corresponding author and a recent Ph.D. graduate of Stanford University who worked on the chip while at UC San Diego, where he was co-advised by Gert Cauwenberghs in the Department of Bioengineering.The research team, co-led by bioengineers at the University of California San Diego, presents their results in the Aug. 17 issue of Nature.Currently, AI computing is both power hungry and computationally expensive. Most AI applications on edge devices involve moving data from the devices to the cloud, where the AI processes and analyzes it. Then the results are moved back to the device. That's because most edge devices are battery-powered and as a result only have a limited amount of power that can be dedicated to computing.By reducing power consumption needed for AI inference at the edge, this NeuRRAM chip could lead to more robust, smarter and accessible edge devices and smarter manufacturing. It could also lead to better data privacy as the transfer of data from devices to the cloud comes with increased security risks.On AI chips, moving data from memory to computing units is one major bottleneck.\"It's the equivalent of doing an eight-hour commute for a two-hour work day,\" Wan said.To solve this data transfer issue, researchers used what is known as resistive random-access memory, a type of non-volatile memory that allows for computation directly within memory rather than in separate computing units. RRAM and other emerging memory technologies used as synapse arrays for neuromorphic computing were pioneered in the lab of Philip Wong, Wan's advisor at Stanford and a main contributor to this work. Computation with RRAM chips is not necessarily new, but generally it leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the computations performed on the chip and a lack of flexibility in the chip's architecture.\"Compute-in-memory has been common practice in neuromorphic engineering since it was introduced more than 30 years ago,\" Cauwenberghs said. \"What is new with NeuRRAM is that the extreme efficiency now goes together with great flexibility for diverse AI applications with almost no loss in accuracy over standard digital general-purpose compute platforms.\"A carefully crafted methodology was key to the work with multiple levels of \"co-optimization\" across the abstraction layers of hardware and software, from the design of the chip to its configuration to run various AI tasks. In addition, the team made sure to account for various constraints that span from memory device physics to circuits and network architecture.\"This chip now provides us with a platform to address these problems across the stack from devices and circuits to algorithms,\" said Siddharth Joshi, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Notre Dame, who started working on the project as a Ph.D. student and postdoctoral researcher in Cauwenberghs lab at UC San Diego.Chip performanceResearchers measured the chip's energy efficiency by a measure known as energy-delay product, or EDP. EDP combines both the amount of energy consumed for every operation and the amount of times it takes to complete the operation. By this measure, the NeuRRAM chip achieves 1.6 to 2.3 times lower EDP (lower is better) and 7 to 13 times higher computational density than state-of-the-art chips.Researchers ran various AI tasks on the chip. It achieved 99% accuracy on a handwritten digit recognition task; 85.7% on an image classification task; and 84.7% on a Google speech command recognition task. In addition, the chip also achieved a 70% reduction in image-reconstruction error on an image-recovery task. These results are comparable to existing digital chips that perform computation under the same bit-precision, but with drastic savings in energy.Researchers point out that one key contribution of the paper is that all the results featured are obtained directly on the hardware. In many previous works of compute-in-memory chips, AI benchmark results were often obtained partially by software simulation.Next steps include improving architectures and circuits and scaling the design to more advanced technology nodes. Researchers also plan to tackle other applications, such as spiking neural networks.\"We can do better at the device level, improve circuit design to implement additional features and address diverse applications with our dynamic NeuRRAM platform,\" said Rajkumar Kubendran, an assistant professor for the University of Pittsburgh, who started work on the project while a Ph.D. student in Cauwenberghs' research group at UC San Diego.In addition, Wan is a founding member of a startup that works on productizing the compute-in-memory technology. \"As a researcher and an engineer, my ambition is to bring research innovations from labs into practical use,\" Wan said.New architectureThe key to NeuRRAM's energy efficiency is an innovative method to sense output in memory. Conventional approaches use voltage as input and measure current as the result. But this leads to the need for more complex and more power hungry circuits. In NeuRRAM, the team engineered a neuron circuit that senses voltage and performs analog-to-digital conversion in an energy efficient manner. This voltage-mode sensing can activate all the rows and all the columns of an RRAM array in a single computing cycle, allowing higher parallelism.In the NeuRRAM architecture, CMOS neuron circuits are physically interleaved with RRAM weights. It differs from conventional designs where CMOS circuits are typically on the peripheral of RRAM weights.The neuron's connections with the RRAM array can be configured to serve as either input or output of the neuron. This allows neural network inference in various data flow directions without incurring overheads in area or power consumption. This in turn makes the architecture easier to reconfigure.To make sure that accuracy of the AI computations can be preserved across various neural network architectures, researchers developed a set of hardware algorithm co-optimization techniques. The techniques were verified on various neural networks including convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory, and restricted Boltzmann machines.As a neuromorphic AI chip, NeuroRRAM performs parallel distributed processing across 48 neurosynaptic cores. To simultaneously achieve high versatility and high efficiency, NeuRRAM supports data-parallelism by mapping a layer in the neural network model onto multiple cores for parallel inference on multiple data. Also, NeuRRAM offers model-parallelism by mapping different layers of a model onto different cores and performing inference in a pipelined fashion.An international research teamThe work is the result of an international team of researchers.The UC San Diego team designed the CMOS circuits that implement the neural functions interfacing with the RRAM arrays to support the synaptic functions in the chip's architecture, for high efficiency and versatility. Wan, working closely with the entire team, implemented the design; characterized the chip; trained the AI models; and executed the experiments. Wan also developed a software toolchain that maps AI applications onto the chip.The RRAM synapse array and its operating conditions were extensively characterized and optimized at Stanford University.The RRAM array was fabricated and integrated onto CMOS at Tsinghua University.The Team at Notre Dame contributed to both the design and architecture of the chip and the subsequent machine learning model design and training.", "abstract": "近日，美国加州大学圣地亚哥分校的研究人员开发出一种直接在内存中运行的芯片（NeuRRAM芯片）。目前，人工智能计算的成本非常高，边缘设备上的大多数人工智能应用程序都需要将数据从设备移动到云端，人工智能需要在云上处理和分析数据，然后将结果发送到中心服务器。由于大多数边缘设备都需要电池供电，因此会消耗大量电能用于计算。这种新的NeuRRAM芯片可以随时随地执行复杂任务，而不依赖于与中心服务器的网络连接。此外NeuRRAM芯片不仅比最先进的“存内计算”芯片能效高1倍，还能提供与传统数字芯片一样准确的计算结果。研究人员表示，NeuRRAM芯片是高度通用的，支持多种不同神经网络模型和架构，因此该芯片可用于许多不同的应用，包括图像识别、重建以及声音识别。该研究成果将有望促进人工智能计算的发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-neuromorphic-chip-ai-edge-small.html"}, {"title": "德国研发出可快速打印微米级零件的激光打印工艺", "keyword": "激光打印工艺 3D打印 微米级零件 树脂 高分辨率", "content_zh": "用两个激光从塑料中精确、快速、廉价地冲刺物体的快如闪电的3D微打印是许多3D打印过程的目标。 然而，速度和高分辨率仍然是一个技术挑战。 卡尔斯鲁厄理工学院(KIT)、海德堡大学和昆士兰科技大学(QUT)的一个研究小组为实现这一目标已经取得了很大进展。 它开发了一种激光打印工艺，一眨眼就能打印出微米大小的零件。 国际团队将这项工作发表在《自然·光子学》上。 立体光刻3D打印是目前最流行的塑料增材制造工艺之一，用于私人和工业应用。 在立体光刻术中，3D物体的各层被一个接一个地投射到装满树脂的容器中。 树脂用紫外光固化。 然而，以往的立体光刻方法速度慢，分辨率太低。 试剂盒研究人员使用的光片3D打印是一种快速和高分辨率的替代方案。在光片3D打印中，蓝光被投射到装满液体树脂的容器中。 蓝光预激活树脂。 在第二阶段，红色激光束提供固化树脂所需的额外能量。 然而，3D打印只能快速打印从预先激活状态迅速恢复到原始状态的树脂。 只有这样才能打印下一层。 因此，返回时间规定了两个连续层之间的等待时间，从而规定了打印速度。 “对于我们使用的树脂，返回时间不到100微秒，这允许高打印速度，”第一作者文森特·哈恩说，他来自KIT应用物理研究所(APH)。微米大小的结构在眨眼之间利用这种新树脂，研究人员建造了一台特殊的3D打印机。 在这种打印机中，蓝色激光二极管被用来将图像投影到使用高分辨率显示器的液体树脂中，该显示器具有高帧率。 红色激光形成一个薄的“光片”光束，并在树脂中垂直穿过蓝色光束。 通过这种安排，该团队能够在几百毫秒内，即一眨眼的时间内，3D打印出微米大小的零件。 然而，它不应该止步于此：“有了更敏感的树脂，我们甚至可以在3D打印机中使用LED来代替激光，”APH的马丁·韦格纳教授说。 “最终，我们希望打印厘米大小的3D结构，同时保持微米分辨率和高打印速度。” ", "content_en": "Fast-as-lightning 3D microprinting with two lasersPrinting objects from plastic precisely, quickly, and inexpensively is the goal of many 3D printing processes. However, speed and high resolution remain a technological challenge. A research team from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Heidelberg University, and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has come a long way toward achieving this goal. It developed a laser printing process that can print micrometer-sized parts in the blink of an eye. The international team published the work in Nature Photonics. Stereolithography 3D printing is currently one of the most popular additive manufacturing processes for plastics, both for private and industrial applications. In stereolithography, the layers of a 3D object are projected one by one into a container filled with resin. The resin is cured by UV light. However, previous stereolithography methods are slow and have too low a resolution. Light-sheet 3D printing, which is used by the KIT researchers, is a fast and high-resolution alternative.3D printing with two colors in two stagesIn light-sheet 3D printing, blue light is projected into a container filled with a liquid resin. The blue light pre-activates the resin. In a second stage, a red laser beam provides the additional energy needed to cure the resin. However, 3D printing can only print quickly resins that quickly return from their pre-activated state to their original state. Only then can the next layer be printed. Consequently, the return time dictates the waiting time between two successive layers and thus the printing speed. \"For the resin we used, the return time was less than 100 microseconds, which allows for high printing speeds,\" says first author Vincent Hahn from KIT's Institute of Applied Physics (APH).Micrometer-sized structures in just the blink of an eyeTo take advantage of this new resin, the researchers built a special 3D printer. In this printer, blue laser diodes are used to project images into the liquid resin using a high-resolution display with a high frame rate. The red laser is formed into a thin \"light sheet\" beam and crosses the blue beam vertically in the resin. With this arrangement, the team was able to 3D print micrometer-sized parts in a few hundred milliseconds, i.e. in the blink of an eye. However, it should not stop there: \"With more sensitive resins, we could even use LEDs instead of lasers in our 3D printer,\" says Professor Martin Wegener of APH. \"Ultimately, we want to print 3D structures that are centimeters in size, while maintaining micrometer resolution and high printing speeds.\"", "abstract": "精确、快速、廉价地利用塑料打印物体是3D打印工艺追求的目标。然而，打印的速度和分辨率仍然是很大的技术挑战。近日，由德国卡尔斯鲁厄理工学院（KIT）、海德堡大学和昆士兰科技大学共同领导的研究团队研发出一种全新的激光打印工艺，可以在眨眼的一瞬间精确打印出微米级尺寸的零件。在这项新研究中，研究人员使用两种激光来进行超快3D打印。在打印过程中，蓝色激光束首先被投射到装满液体树脂的容器中来激活树脂。然后，在第二阶段，利用红色激光束提供固化树脂所需的额外能量。由于3D打印只能快速打印从预激活状态恢复到原始状态的树脂。因此，返回时间决定了两个连续层之间的等待时间，从而决定了打印的速度。为此，研究人员使用了新的树脂，使其返回时间缩短至100微秒，使打印速度大幅提高。通过这种设计，研究人员在几百毫秒内，即一眨眼的时间，就能实现微米级尺寸精密零件的3D打印。该研究克服了3D打印在速度和高分辨率上的巨大挑战，未来有望在保持微米级分辨率和高打印速度的条件下，打印出更加精密的3D结构。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-10-fast-as-lightning-3d-microprinting-lasers.html"}, {"title": "美国研发出首个多色集成激光器", "keyword": "普克尔斯效应 集成半导体激光器 窄线宽激光器", "content_zh": "研究人员开发出可以“重塑集成光子学景观”的激光器，如何将布满房间的基准激光器的优点集成到指甲大小的半导体芯片上？ 罗切斯特大学电气与计算机工程教授林强领导的一个研究小组在应对这一挑战方面树立了新的里程碑。第一个多色集成激光器：？在电信波长发射高相干光？允许激光频率以创纪录的速度调谐？是第一个可快速配置的窄线宽激光器。《自然通讯》杂志描述了可见光波段项目。该项目由加州大学/圣巴巴拉分校杰出教授约翰·鲍尔斯和加州理工学院教授克里·瓦哈拉共同领导。 克莱姆森大学教授林珠也参与了该项目。该技术“有潜力重塑集成光子学的景观，”联合第一作者、前博士李明晓写道 罗切斯特哈吉姆工程与应用科学学院林的纳米光子学实验室的学生，以及加州大学/圣巴巴拉分校的前博士后林昌。它将为集成半导体激光器在激光雷达（光探测和测距）遥感中的新应用铺平道路，例如，用于自动驾驶汽车。 这项技术还可能导致微波光子学、原子物理学和AR/VR的进步。“完全片上激光解决方案”集成半导体激光器一直是集成光子学的核心，在过去几十年里，它推动了信息技术和基础科学的许多进步。“然而，尽管取得了这些令人印象深刻的成就，但当前集成激光器缺乏关键功能，”李说。 “两个主要挑战，缺乏快速可重构性和狭窄的光谱窗口，已经成为阻碍许多发展中应用进展的主要瓶颈，”常补充说。研究人员表示，他们已经通过基于Pockels效应的新型集成半导体激光器克服了这些挑战。 该激光器与绝缘体上的铌酸锂平台集成在一起。新技术包括以下优点：？快速频率啁啾，这在激光雷达传感器系统中是无价的，该系统通过记录短脉冲发射和反射光接收之间的时间来测量距离。？频率转换能力，克服了传统集成半导体激光器的光谱带宽限制。 这将“显著缓解”开发新波长激光器的困难。？窄波长和快速可重构性，为原子物理中探测和操纵原子和离子提供“完全片上激光解决方案”，并有利于短波长的AR/VR和其他应用。 ", "content_en": "Researchers develop laser that could 'reshape the landscape of integrated photonics'How do you integrate the advantages of a benchtop laser that fills a room onto a semiconductor chip the size of a fingernail?

Developed by KAUST, this could help find high-performance transport fuels that burn efficiently while releasing little carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere.Greenhouse gas emissions are major contributors to rising global temperatures. A large proportion of CO2 emissions comes from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline, that power most automotive engines. A promising solution to these environmental issues is to engineer transport fuels that offer enhanced efficiency and lower carbon emissions.There are several methods developed for fuel screening, but they are usually validated only on smaller blends, or require additional preprocessing, which makes these configurations unsuitable for inverse fuel design. \"The key bottleneck is screening complex mixtures containing hundreds of components to predict synergistic and antagonistic effects of species on the resultant mixture properties,\" says first author Nursulu Kuzhagaliyeva, a Ph.D. student in Mani Sarathy's research group.Kuzhagaliyeva, Sarathy and coworkers constructed a deep learning model—comprising multiple smaller networks dedicated to specific tasks—to screen fuels efficiently. \"This problem was a good fit for deep learning that allows capturing nonlinear interactions between species,\" Kuzhagaliyeva says. In the inverse-design approach, the researchers first defined combustion-related properties, such as fuel ignition quality and sooting propensity, and then determined potential fuels according to these properties.Publicly available experimental data are scarce. Therefore, the researchers built an extensive database using experimental measurements from the literature to train the model. The database consisted of different types of pure compounds, surrogate fuel blends and complex mixtures, such as gasoline.There was no model adaptable to inverse fuel design, so the researchers had to embed vector representations in the model, Kuzhagaliyeva says. Inspired by text processing techniques that relate words to phrases using hidden vectors, they introduced a mixing operator that directly connects hidden representations of pure compounds and mixtures through linear combinations. They also added search algorithms to detect fuel mixtures that match the predefined properties within a chemical space.The model accurately predicted the fuel ignition quality and sooting propensity of various molecules and mixtures. It also identified several fuel blends fitting the predefined criteria.The team is now enhancing model accuracy by extending the property database to other criteria, such as volatility, viscosity and pollutant formation.

But in reality, 3D printing is still limited in the properties and types of materials that are available for use, especially when printing at very small scales. Researchers at Stanford have developed a new material for printing at the nanoscale—creating structures that are a fraction of the width of a human hair—and used it to print minuscule lattices that are both strong and light. In a paper published in Science, the researchers demonstrated that the new material is able to absorb twice as much energy than other 3D-printed materials of a comparable density. In the future, their invention could be used to create better lightweight protection for fragile pieces of satellites, drones, and microelectronics.\"There's a lot of interest right now in designing different types of 3D structures for mechanical performance,\" says Wendy Gu, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and a corresponding author on the paper. \"What we've done on top of that is develop a material that is really good at resisting forces, so it's not just the 3D structure, but also the material that provides very good protection.\"Introducing metal nanoclustersTo design a better material for 3D printing, Gu and her colleagues incorporated metal nanoclusters—tiny clumps of atoms—into their printing medium. The researchers are printing with a method known as two-photon lithography, where the printing material is hardened through a chemical reaction initiated by laser light. They found that their nanoclusters were very good at jump-starting this reaction and resulted in a material that was a composite of the polymer printing medium and metal.\"The nanoclusters have very good properties for taking in the laser light, and then converting that to a chemical reaction,\" Gu says. \"And they're able to do this with several classes of polymers, so they're even more versatile than I expected.\"The researchers were able to combine metal nanoclusters with acrylates, epoxies, and proteins—several common classes of polymers that are used in 3D printing. Moreover, the nanoclusters helped to speed up the printing process. By combining the nanoclusters with proteins, for example, Gu and her colleagues were able to print at a rate of 100 millimeters per second, which is about 100 times faster than had previously been achieved in nanoscale protein printing.The researchers tested their new material with several different lattice structures, prioritizing the ability to carry a heavy load in some and the ability to absorb an impact in others. With the nanocluster-polymer composite, all the structures demonstrated an impressive combination of energy absorption, strength, and recoverability—essentially the ability to squish and spring back.\"The lattice structure certainly matters, but what we're showing here is that if the material it's made out of is optimized, that's more important for performance,\" Gu says. \"You don't have to worry about exactly what the 3D structure is if you have the right materials to print with.\"Copying the natural worldIn some ways, Gu and her colleagues are trying to mimic what nature has already perfected. Bone, for example, gets its resilience from the combination of a hard exterior, nanoscale porosity, and small amounts of soft material. This combination of a 3D structure and multiple, well-designed materials allows our bones to transfer energy without breaking (most of the time) and still remain relatively lightweight. Ideally, 3D-printed protective structures would also have multiple types of material within them, some harder and some softer, to better disperse an impact and resist crushing.\"Since the nanoclusters are able to polymerize these different classes of chemicals, we may be able to use them to print multiple materials in one structure,\" Gu says. \"That's one thing we'd like to aim for.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国斯坦福大学研究团队研发出了一种新的纳米级3D打印复合材料，它的直径只有人类头发宽度的几分之一大小，可为卫星、无人机和微电子设备提供更好的结构保护。科幻小说曾设想快速的3D打印过程，实现用任何材料快速创建新的物体。但在现实中，3D打印仍然受到可用材料的属性和类型的限制，特别是在非常小的尺度内实现打印十分困难。在新研究中，研究人员将金属纳米团簇，融入打印介质中。然后，再用双光子光刻法进行打印，打印材料通过激光引发的化学反应发生硬化，最终产生一种由聚合物打印介质和金属组成的复合材料。研究人员表示，如果将金属纳米团簇与蛋白质相结合，他们能够以每秒100毫米的速度进行打印，相较传统3D打印速度提高约100倍。此外，该团队还测试了几种具有不同晶格结构的新材料，并优先考虑了材料的承载重负荷能力和冲击吸收能力。研究结果表明，有了金属纳米团簇-聚合物复合材料，所有结构都能够实现能量吸收、强度和可恢复性的综合效果。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-nanoscale-3d-material-satellites-drones.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出制造钙钛矿氧化物半导体薄膜的新方法", "keyword": "钙钛矿氧化物 半导体薄膜 智能材料", "content_zh": "研究人员发现制造“智能”材料独立膜的新方法明尼苏达大学双城分校领导的科学家和工程师团队开发了一种制造钙钛矿氧化物半导体薄膜的新方法，钙钛矿氧化物半导体是一类“智能”材料，具有独特的性质，可以随着光、磁场或电场等刺激而变化。这项发现将使研究人员能够利用这些性质，甚至将它们与其他新兴的纳米材料结合，制造更好的设备，如传感器、智能纺织品， 和柔性电子学。这篇论文发表在《科学进展》上。以薄膜形式生产材料使它们更容易集成到电子器件的小部件中。 许多薄膜是用一种称为外延的技术制成的，这种技术包括将材料的原子放置在衬底或模板上，以形成薄片材料，一次一层原子。 然而，大多数通过外延产生的薄膜都“粘”在其宿主衬底上，限制了它们的用途。 如果薄膜从基底上分离成为独立膜，它就会变得更有功能。明尼苏达大学领导的团队找到了一种新的方法，成功地制造了一种特殊金属氧化物--钛酸锶--的膜，他们的方法绕过了过去困扰独立金属氧化物薄膜合成的几个问题。巴拉特·贾兰说：“我们创造了一种方法，可以用几乎任何氧化物材料制造独立膜，将其剥离，然后将其转移到我们想要的任何感兴趣的主题上。” 他是这篇论文的资深作者，也是明尼苏达大学化学工程和材料科学系的教授和壳牌教授。 “现在，我们可以通过将这些材料与其他纳米材料结合来受益于这些材料的功能，这将使各种高功能、高效率的器件成为可能。”用“智能”氧化物材料制作独立膜是一项挑战，因为原子在所有三维都是结合的，而不像石墨烯这样的二维材料。 在氧化物材料中制造膜的一种方法是使用一种称为远程外延的技术，该技术使用一层石墨烯作为衬底和薄膜材料之间的中介。这种方法允许薄膜氧化物材料形成薄膜，并像胶带一样从衬底上剥离，形成独立的膜。 然而，对金属氧化物使用这种方法的最大障碍是，材料中的氧在接触时氧化石墨烯，破坏样本。使用混合分子束外延技术，研究人员能够通过使用已经与氧结合的钛来解决这个问题，这是明尼苏达大学贾兰实验室首创的一种技术。 此外，他们的方法允许自动化学计量控制，这意味着他们可以自动控制组成。“我们第一次展示了一种新的方法，通过做几个实验，我们有了一种新的方法，可以在确保石墨烯不被氧化的同时制造复杂的氧化物。这是合成科学的一个重要里程碑，”贾兰说。 “而且，我们现在有办法用自动化学计量控制来制造这些复杂的氧化物膜。没有人能做到这一点。”贾兰团队的材料科学家与明尼苏达大学电气和计算机工程系教授史蒂文·科斯特实验室的工程研究人员密切合作，该实验室专注于制造二维材料。“这些复杂氧化物是一类广泛的材料，对它们来说有很多非常重要的先天功能，”科斯特说，他也是这项研究的高级作者，也是明尼苏达双城大学明尼苏达纳米中心的主任。 “现在，我们可以考虑用它们为电子设备制造极小的晶体管，以及广泛的其他应用，包括柔性传感器、智能纺织品和非易失性存储器。” ", "content_en": "Researchers discover new process to create freestanding membranes of 'smart' materialsA University of Minnesota Twin Cities-led team of scientists and engineers has developed a new method for making thin films of perovskite oxide semiconductors, a class of \"smart\" materials with unique properties that can change in response to stimuli like light, magnetic fields, or electric fields.The discovery will allow researchers to harness these properties and even combine them with other emerging nano-scale materials to make better devices such as sensors, smart textiles, and flexible electronics.The paper is published in Science Advances.Producing materials in thin-film form makes them easier to integrate into smaller components for electronic devices. Many thin films are made using a technique called epitaxy, which consists of placing atoms of a material on a substrate, or a template of sorts, to create a thin sheet of material, one atomic layer at a time. However, most thin films created via epitaxy are \"stuck\" on their host substrate, limiting their uses. If the thin film is detached from the substrate to become a freestanding membrane, it becomes much more functional.The University of Minnesota-led team has found a new way to successfully create a membrane of a particular metal oxide—strontium titanate—and their method circumvents several issues that have plagued the synthesis of freestanding metal oxide films in the past.\"We have created a process where we can make a freestanding membrane of virtually any oxide material, exfoliate it, and then transfer it onto any subject of interest we want,\" said Bharat Jalan, a senior author on the paper and a professor and Shell Chair in the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. \"Now, we can benefit from the functionality of these materials by combining them with other nano-scale materials, which would enable a wide range of highly functional, highly efficient devices.\"Making freestanding membranes of \"smart\" oxide materials is challenging because the atoms are bonded in all three dimensions, unlike in a two-dimensional material, such as graphene. One method of making membranes in oxide materials is using a technique called remote epitaxy, which uses a layer of graphene as an intermediary between the substrate and the thin-film material.This approach allows the thin-film oxide material to form a thin film and be peeled off, like a piece of tape, from the substrate, creating a freestanding membrane. However, the biggest barrier to using this method with metal oxides is that the oxygen in the material oxidizes the graphene on contact, ruining the sample.Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, a technique pioneered by Jalan's lab at the University of Minnesota, the researchers were able to get around this issue by using titanium that was already bonded to oxygen. Plus, their method allows for automatic stoichiometric control, meaning they can automatically control the composition.\"We showed for the first time, and conclusively by doing several experiments, that we have a new method which allows us to make complex oxide while ensuring that graphene is not oxidized. That's a major milestone in synthesis science,\" Jalan said. \"And, we now have a way to make these complex oxide membranes with an automatic stoichiometric control. No one has been able to do that.\"The materials scientists on Jalan's team worked closely with engineering researchers in University of Minnesota Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Steven Koester's lab, which focuses on making 2D materials.\"These complex oxides are a broad class of materials that have a lot of really important innate functions to them,\" said Koester, also a senior author of the study and the director of the Minnesota Nano Center at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. \"Now, we can think about using them to make extremely small transistors for electronic devices, and in a wide array of other applications including flexible sensors, smart textiles, and non-volatile memories.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国明尼苏达大学研究人员开发出一种制造钙钛矿氧化物半导体薄膜的新方法，可制备出具有独特性质的“智能”材料，对光、磁场或电场等刺激做出反应。传统方法使用远程外延技术，以石墨烯作为衬底和薄膜材料间的中介形成氧化物薄膜，并利用胶带从基材上剥离薄膜材料。但是传统方法用于金属氧化物的最大障碍是材料中的氧气会氧化接触的石墨烯，造成样品破坏。为此，研究人员使用混合分子束外延技术，使用已与氧气结合的钛来解决这一问题。此外，新方法还能实现自动化学计量控制，意味着他们可自动控制材料合成成分。使用新方法可以用几乎任何氧化物材料制作定制化的薄膜，并将其转移到任何感兴趣的材料上。该研究成果将有望与其他新兴纳米材料结合起来，制造出更好的电子设备，如先进传感器、智能纺织品和柔性电子产品等。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-freestanding-membranes-smart-materials.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出全新半导体计算模型", "keyword": "半导体 计算模型 掺杂 缺陷 ", "content_zh": "美国北卡罗来纳州立大学的研究人员利用计算分析方法预测了半导体材料硒化锌（ZnSe）在掺杂卤素元素时光学性质的变化，并发现这一预测得到了实验结果的证实。 他们的方法可以加快识别和创造量子应用中有用材料的过程。创造具有理想性能的半导体意味着利用点缺陷--材料中可能缺少原子或存在杂质的位置。 通过操纵材料中的这些位置，通常是通过添加不同的元素（这一过程被称为“掺杂”），设计师可以获得不同的性能。“缺陷是不可避免的，即使是在‘纯’材料中，”NC State大学学院学者、材料科学与工程教授道格·欧文（Doug Irving）表示。 “我们希望通过掺杂与这些空间接触，以改变材料的某些性质。但是找出在掺杂中使用哪些元素是耗时耗力的。如果我们可以使用计算机模型来预测这些结果，这将使材料工程师能够专注于具有最佳潜力的元素。”在一项原理证明研究中，欧文和他的团队使用计算分析来预测使用卤素元素氯和氟作为ZnSe掺杂剂的结果。 他们选择这些元素是因为卤素掺杂的ZnSe已经被广泛研究，但潜在的缺陷化学还没有很好地建立。该模型分析了缺陷位置氯和氟的所有可能组合，并正确预测了结果，如电子学和光学性质、电离能和掺杂ZnSe的发光。欧文说：“通过观察已知材料中缺陷的电子学和光学性质，我们能够确定这种方法可以以预测的方式使用。” “所以我们可以用它来搜索可能有趣的缺陷和相互作用。”就像ZnSe这样的光学材料而言，改变材料吸收或发射光的方式可以让研究人员将其用于可以在更高温度下工作的量子应用，因为某些缺陷对高温不那么敏感。欧文说：“除了重新审视像ZnSe这样的半导体在量子应用中的潜在用途之外，这项工作的更广泛含义是最令人兴奋的部分。” “这是一个推动我们走向更大目标的基础性工作：使用预测技术有效识别缺陷，以及使用该技术对这些材料的基本理解。”这项研究发表在《物理化学快报》杂志上。 ", "content_en": "Computational model could speed development of semiconductors useful in quantum applicationsResearchers from North Carolina State University used computational analysis to predict how optical properties of semiconductor material zinc selenide (ZnSe) change when doped with halogen elements, and found the predictions were confirmed by experimental results.

To detect unpredictable conditions on the road and nimbly respond, the sensor must perceive the sides and rear as well as the front of the vehicle. However, it has been impossible to observe the front and rear of the vehicle simultaneously because a rotating LiDAR sensor was used.To overcome this issue, a research team led by Professor Junsuk Rho (Department of Mechanical Engineering and Department of Chemical Engineering) and Ph.D. candidates Gyeongtae Kim, Yeseul Kim, and Jooyeong Yun (Department of Mechanical Engineering) from POSTECH has developed a fixed LiDAR sensor that has a 360° view, in collaboration with Professor Inki Kim (Department of Biophysics) from Sungkyunkwan University.This new sensor is drawing attention as an original technology that can enable an ultra-small LiDAR sensor since it is made from the metasurface, which is an ultra-thin flat optical device that is only one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair strand.Using the metasurface can greatly expand the viewing angle of the LiDAR to recognize objects three-dimensionally. The research team succeeded in extending the viewing angle of the LiDAR sensor to 360° by modifying the design and periodically arranging the nanostructures that make up the metasurface.It is possible to extract three-dimensional information of objects in 360° regions by scattering more than 10,000 dot array (light) from the metasurface to objects and photographing the irradiated point pattern with a camera.This type of LiDAR sensor is used for the iPhone face recognition function (Face ID). The iPhone uses a dot projector device to create the point sets but has several limitations; the uniformity and viewing angle of the point pattern are limited, and the size of the device is large.The study is significant in that the technology that allows cell phones, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) glasses, and unmanned robots to recognize the 3D information of the surrounding environment is fabricated with nano-optical elements.

Over the past few decades, a tremendous amount of effort has been dedicated to making solar power more prominent. However, the technology currently faces several challenges that limit widespread application.In the case of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)—a highly promising photovoltaic technology—one of the main problems is dye aggregation. By design, DSSCs are electrochemical systems that mimic photosynthesis in plants; they rely on special photosensitive dyes to convert sunlight into electricity. Ideally, the dye should be applied evenly over the surface of an oxide electrode behind a transparent layer so that energy from absorbed sunlight can be transferred easily to the dye's electrons. This process generates free electrons that power an external circuit. However, most dyes tend to aggregate over the electrode surface in a way that hinders the desired flow of both light and electric charges. This takes a toll on the performance of DSSCs that has proven difficult to overcome.Fortunately, a team of scientists led by Associate Professor Tomohiko Inomata of Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan, may have just found a solution to this problem. In their recent study published in RSC Advances, they showed that certain ionic liquids (molten salts that are in liquid state at relatively low temperatures) can suppress dye aggregation to an impressive degree. Other members of this research team included Ms. Ayaka Matsunaga and Prof. Tomohiro Ozawa from Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Prof. Hideki Masuda from Aichi Institute of Technology, Japan.But, how do ionic liquids achieve this feat? To shed light on the exact mechanism at play, the researchers focused on two ionic liquids with markedly different molecular sizes and two types of dyes. Both the ionic liquids had a similar molecular structure comprising an anchor that binds well to the electrode (titanium dioxide, TiO2), a main polymer chain linking this anchor to a phosphor atom, and three additional short polymer chains protruding from the phosphor atom and away from the main \"vertical\" chain.The researchers submerged the TiO2 electrodes in solutions with different dye-to-ionic-liquid proportions and carefully analyzed how the different molecules adhered to them. After optimizing the synthesis procedure, they found that DSSCs made using the ionic liquid with a longer molecular structure had a remarkably better performance than their counterparts with non-modified oxide electrodes. \"The spatially bulky molecular structure of ionic liquids acts as an effective anti-aggregation agent without significantly impacting the amount of dye adsorbed into the electrode,\" explains Dr. Inomata. \"Most importantly, the introduction of the larger ionic liquid improves all the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs.\"Needless to say, improving solar cell technology could give us an edge in the fight against the ongoing energy and climate crisis. Although ionic liquids are typically expensive, the way it is used by the team is, in fact, cost-effective. \"Put simply, the idea is to apply ionic liquids only at the required part of the device—in this case, the electrode's surface,\" states Dr. Inomata.The team believes that the widespread use of electrodes modified with ionic liquids could pave the way for highly functional yet affordable materials for solar cells and catalytic systems. Since the structure of ionic liquids can be tuned during their synthesis, they offer a much-needed versatility as anti-aggregation agents.", "abstract": "近日，由日本名古屋工业大学领导的研究团队研发出一种能够克服太阳能电池因染料聚集问题而导致电池性能下降的新技术。太阳能电池正迅速成为世界上许多国家生产清洁电力的主要方式。根据设计，染料敏化太阳能电池（DSSC）是一种模仿植物光合作用的电化学系统，依靠特殊光敏染料将光能转化为电能。理想情况下，染料应均匀涂布在透明层后面的氧化物电极表面，这样吸收的阳光能量就可以很容易地转移到染料电子上。这个过程产生的自由电子，可为外部电路供电。然而，大多数染料倾向于聚集在电极表面，阻碍光和电荷的流动。这给DSSC的性能带来了损失。在新研究中，研究人员找到了解决该问题的方法。他们发现某些离子液体，在相对较低温度下呈液态的熔盐，可在很大程度上抑制染料聚集。研究人员表示，离子液体的空间大分子结构是一种有效的抗聚集剂，不会显著影响电极吸附的染料量。该研究为研发对抗能源和气候危机的设备提供了新方法，推动了新型太阳能电池领域的发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-dye-aggregation-molten-salts-solar.html"}, {"title": "英国开发出可用于柔性显示器和太阳能电池分子的人工智能算法", "keyword": "分子 人工智能算法 光分子 有机分子 有机发光二极管 ", "content_zh": "人工智能照亮了未来电子产品的道路，从弯曲电视到轻量级太阳能电池。人工智能正在改变现代电子产品--加速可弯曲电视屏幕的设计，超轻量级革命性太阳能电池等。在2月6日发表在《自然》杂志上的一项研究中，科学家使用一种人工智能算法创造了新的分子，适合直接来自科幻电影的电子产品。 该算法能够通过在计算机上一个原子一个原子地构建它们来快速设计数百万以前未发现的分子。生成式深度学习方法已经流行起来，用于创建图像的“深度赝品”，甚至计算机生成的音乐。 生成性人工智能在化学领域的应用是最近才出现的，有可能重塑科学发现。 在实验室里，通过人类的试验和错误来寻找具有最佳性质的分子，否则就像大海捞针一样。人工智能的使用使得一种由材料的预期用途驱动的分子设计成为可能。 生成式深度学习能够比以往任何技术都更有效地创建满足某些标准的三维分子。 在这项由华威大学领导的研究中，作者训练人工智能寻找能够吸收和发射某种颜色的光并且易于在实验室合成的分子。 相应的分子也可以设计得很小，适合大规模生产，有望使新一代柔性电视和屏幕更便宜、更灵活、更轻、色彩更鲜艳。领导这项研究的沃里克大学计算表面化学和界面物理学教授莱因哈德·毛雷尔（Reinhard Maurer）说：“我们的研究开发了一种算法，可以专注于狭窄的电子学和光学性质，为电子应用提出了新的分子。 最初，该算法只会生成无意义的分子，直到我们训练它以确保这些分子可以在实验室中很容易地制造出来。 这种方法可以帮助优化有机分子的电子和光学性质，这些分子可以用于有机发光二极管(OLEDS)，用于柔性显示器和太阳能电池的分子。毛勒教授说，支持设计和发现的人工智能开始在科学中发挥重要作用：“现代材料太复杂了，无法进行基于实验室的试错搜索。 人工智能驱动的计算设计可以帮助提出全新的分子，但也可以优化现有的分子。 属性驱动设计的可能应用领域远远超出了电子学。 这一过程可以通过预测分子的溶解度或它们与酶结合的能力来帮助设计新药，这两者都是药物的重要性质。“ ", "content_en": "AI lights the way for futuristic electronics, from bendy TVs to lightweight solar cellsArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming modern electronics—accelerating the design of bendable TV screens, ultra-lightweight revolutionized solar cells and more.In a study published in Nature February 6, scientists used a type of AI algorithm to create new molecules, suited for electronics that could come straight from a sci-fi movie.

The approach can help to optimize electronic and optical properties of organic molecules that can be used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDS) which go into flexible displays and molecules for solar cells.\"According to Professor Maurer, AI to support design and discovery is starting to play an important role in science: \"Modern materials are too complex for lab-based trial and error search. AI-driven computational design can help to propose brand new molecules but also optimize existing ones. Possible application areas for property-driven design go well beyond electronics. The process could help to design new drugs by predicting the solubility of molecules or their ability to bind to enzymes, both important properties of pharmaceuticals.\"", "abstract": "近日，英国华威大学研究人员开发出可创造新分子的人工智能算法。最初，该算法只会生成无意义的分子，直到研究人员对其进行训练，确保这些分子可在实验室中轻松制造出来。实验中，研究人员训练人工智能系统搜索能够吸收和发射在实验室中合成的具有特定颜色的光分子，使其聚焦分子的电子和光学特性，由此设计和构建出用于电子学应用的新分子。研究人员表示，该方法有助于优化有机分子的电子和光学特性，使有机分子用于有机发光二极管，进而用于柔性显示器和太阳能电池分子。因此，将相应的分子设计得越小，就越适合大规模生产，且这样大小的分子有望使新一代柔性电视和屏幕的制造成本更低、功能更灵活、质量更轻、色彩亮度性能更好。该研究为未来开发新型电子产品开辟了新的道路，促进了人工智能技术的发展和应用。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-02-ai-futuristic-electronics-bendy-tvs.html"}, {"title": "德国开发了一种制造局部柔性二极管的新材料", "keyword": "金属硫族卤化物导电材料 晶体管", "content_zh": "新材料将使局部柔性二极管成为可能的二极管允许电流的定向流动。 没有它们，现代电子学将是不可想象的。 直到现在，它们都是由两种不同特性的材料制成的。 慕尼黑工业大学(TUM)的一个研究小组现在发现了一种材料，可以通过简单的温度变化来制造二极管。制造二极管通常需要结合两种不同性质的半导体材料。 在大多数情况下，这些是硅的改性形式，添加不同的元素以产生所需的特性。 这一过程被称为掺杂。用磷、砷或锑掺杂，给材料增加自由电子，被称为n型掺杂。 n是指带负电荷的电子。 相比之下，硼、铝和镓则能束缚硅上的电子，从而产生带正电荷的空穴。 这种材料是磷掺杂的。 将这两种材料结合在一起产生一种二极管，允许电流只在一个方向上流动。温度改变材料特性“我们现在已经找到了一种材料，我们可以通过改变温度来使其成为n导电或p导电，”TUM创新材料合成和表征教授汤姆·尼尔格斯说。 研究人员已经证明，只有几度的温度变化就足以产生这种效应--并且可以在材料内部有温度梯度的情况下创建一个有效的二极管。“当材料处于室温时，我们有一个完全正常的P导体。如果我们然后施加温度梯度，我们可以同时在受热区域产生一个N导体，”尼尔格斯教授解释说。 应用的一个重要方面：室温范围内的效应函数。 “要产生二极管，局部温升仅几度就足够了--在我们的情况下是22°C至35°C。”对于Nilges，消除对掺杂的需求并不是唯一的优势：“生产的每一个二极管都在那里。 而我们的材料却不是这样：随着温度梯度的增加，二极管也消失了。 如果再次需要，就足以制造温度梯度。 如果我们考虑二极管的应用范围，例如在太阳能电池或每一种电子元件中，这项发明的潜力就变得显而易见。“复杂成分对完美材料的寻找涉及12年的工作，现在该团队最终发现了铸币金属硫系卤化物Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3。 它由银、铜、碲和氯等元素组成。 研究人员在探索热电材料时偶然发现了这类化合物，热电材料由热发电。 他们研究的一种材料显示了P-N开关效应。 经过大量的分析和实验，研究人员在Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3中发现了一种在常温下也能显示出预期效果的材料。 尼尔格斯解释说：“其他研究小组也在各种材料中发现了这种开关效应，但到目前为止，还没有人成功地将其转化为特定的应用。”这项研究发表在《先进材料》上。作为下一步，研究人员计划展示他们的材料可以通过温度变化来制造晶体管。 ", "content_en": "New material will make locally flexible diodes possibleDiodes allow directed flows of current. Without them, modern electronics would be inconceivable. Until now, they had to be made out of two materials with different characteristics. A research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has now discovered a material that makes it possible to create a diode with a simple change in temperature.Manufacturing a diode generally involves combining two semiconducting materials with different properties. In most cases these are modified forms of silicon to which different elements are added to create the desired characteristics. This process is known as doping.Doping with phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, which adds free electrons to the material, is called n-type doping. The n refers to the negatively charged electrons. Boron, aluminum and gallium, by contrast, bind electrons from the silicon, resulting in positively charged holes. The material is p-doped. Combining the two materials produces a diode that permits the current to flow only in one direction.Temperature changes material characteristics\"We have now found a material which we can cause to be n-conducting or p-conducting simply by changing the temperature,\" says Tom Nilges, professor of Synthesis and Characterization of Innovative Materials at TUM. The researchers have been able to show that a temperature change of just a few degrees is enough to bring about this effect—and that a functioning diode can be created with a temperature gradient within the material.\"When the material is at room temperature, we have a completely normal p conductor. If we then apply a temperature gradient, we can simultaneously generate an n conductor in the heated areas,\" explains Prof. Nilges. An important aspect for applications: the effect functions in room temperature ranges. \"To generate a diode, a local temperature rise of just a few degrees is enough—in our case from 22 to 35°C.\"For Nilges, the elimination of the need for doping is not the only advantage: \"Every diode that is produced is always there. With our material that is not the case: with the temperature gradient, the diode also disappears. If it is needed again, it is enough to create a temperature gradient. If we think about the range of applications for diodes, for example in solar cells or in every kind of electronic component, the potential of this invention becomes evident.\"Complex compositionThe search for the perfect material involved 12 years of work, which has now culminated in the team's discovery of the coinage metal chalcogenide halide Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3. It consists of the elements silver, copper, tellurium and chlorine. The researchers came across this class of compounds when exploring thermoelectric materials, which generate electricity from heat. One material they studied displayed the p-n switching effect. However, this was observed only in the temperature range around 100°C, which is unsuitable for practical applications.After extensive analysis and experimentation, in Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3 the researchers discovered a material that displays the desired effect and is also suitable for applications at normal temperatures. \"Other research groups have also discovered this switching effect in various materials, but so far nobody has managed to convert it into a specific application,\" explains Nilges.The research is published in Advanced Materials.As the next step the researchers plan to show that their material can be used to create transistors through temperature changes.", "abstract": "近日，德国慕尼黑技术大学的研究人员在探索热电材料时发现了金属硫族卤化物Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3，这是一种新材料，这种材料在室温下显示出了p-n转换效应。只需改变温度，就可以使其成为n型或p型导电材料。而且研究人员已经证明仅仅改变几度的温差就足以产生这种效应，利用材料内部的温度梯度就可以制造出一个正常工作的二极管。如，材料在室温下，它是一个完全正常的p型导体，当局部施加一个温度梯度，就可以在加热区域同时产生一个n型导体。这种材料在太阳能电池或者其他各种电子元件中有着潜在的应用价值，下一步，研究人员的工作计划是利用这种材料研究通过温度变化来制造晶体管。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-material-locally-flexible-diodes.html"}, {"title": "奥地利发现晶体管缺陷会对集成电子电路产生影响", "keyword": "晶体管缺陷 集成电子电路 计算机模型", "content_zh": "检查缺陷对二维集成电子电路的影响几十年来，晶体管--计算机芯片的心脏--变得越来越小。 因此，许多设备中的电子元件可以做得更紧凑、更快、更强大。 但这一发展是否自然停止？ 组件越小，原子结构中的个别缺陷显著改变组件行为的危险就越大。 这适用于已经建立的硅技术和基于2D材料的新型纳米技术。在维也纳技术大学（Tu Wien），在晶体管水平上对这个问题的物理描述进行了密集的工作。 现在，研究人员更进一步，在电子电路的层面上研究缺陷的影响，电子电路有时由几个--有时甚至数十亿个--晶体管组成。 在某些情况下，单个晶体管可以在期望的规格之外工作，但作为由几个晶体管组成的电路的一部分，仍然表现良好。 有了这种电路层面的新方法，小型化的重大进展仍然是可能的。这项研究发表在《先进材料》杂志上。更小的元件，更大的误差“今天最小的晶体管只有几纳米大小，”图温微电子研究所的迈克尔·沃尔特说。 “所以一个人已经进步到原子尺度了。” 但晶体管在原子层面上从来都不是完美的：有时一个原子可能在错误的地方，有时两个不同晶体之间的连接并不十分准确。“在更大的组件中，这种错误不会发挥如此主导的作用。 但是对于几纳米量级的微小晶体管，即使是单个缺陷也会导致晶体管的特性曲线远远超出规定的容差范围。 因此，它被认为是不可用的，“沃尔特继续说。电子元件中材料缺陷的影响通常在工业中被统计记录：成千上万的晶体管被制造和测量。 根据以这种方式确定的可变性，人们可以计算这些晶体管是否可用，或者是否必须调整几何形状或生产过程，并减少缺陷的数量。 例如，在最坏的情况下，必须增加芯片的面积。 这可能会损害芯片的性能并提高其价格。“仅仅寻找性能超出预期参数范围的晶体管是一种过于简化的观点，”沃尔特说。 “毕竟，晶体管连接起来形成一个电子电路--例如，一个反相器，反相由六个晶体管组成的信号或存储器。有趣的问题不是当原子级出现故障时，单个晶体管是否符合某些抽象标准，而是整个电路的行为是否正确。”图温的微电子团队结合实验和计算机模拟来解决这个问题。 许多电子元件被检查，并根据结果建立了复杂的计算机模型。精确的计算机模型使设计稳健的电路成为可能。事实证明，即使有误差的晶体管也不一定是无用的。 沃尔特说：“容错性取决于电路--在设计电路时应该考虑这一点。” 例如，在电子电路的某一特定点上，晶体管可能是特别低故障的，但在同一电路中，另一晶体管的容差较大。 在这种情况下，可以使用两种不同类型的晶体管来确保电路可靠地执行任务。“我们的结果适用于硅晶体管和新型2D半导体，”Waltl澄清道。 “无论你想用什么技术来创造具有更小组件的下一代芯片：无论如何，不可避免的错误的影响不应该像迄今为止那样仅仅用经验来描述，而应该借助于先进的物理计算模型来模拟部分电路或整个电路，以从新的可能性中获得最佳结果。” ", "content_en": "Examining the influence of defects on 2D integrated electronic circuitsFor decades, transistors—the heart of computer chips—have been getting smaller and smaller. As a result, the electronic components in many devices can be made even more compact, faster and also more powerful. But is this development coming to a natural halt? The smaller the components, the greater the danger that individual defects in the atomic structure will significantly change the behavior of the component. This applies to the established silicon technology and novel nanotechnologies based on 2D materials.At Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), intensive work has been done on the physical description of this problem at the transistor level. Now the researchers are going a step further and looking at the influence of defects at the level of electronic circuits, which sometimes consist of several—sometimes even billions—of transistors. In some cases, individual transistors can operate outside the desired specification, but still perform well as part of a circuit consisting of several transistors. With this new approach at the circuit level, significant advances in miniaturization are still possible.The study is published in the journal Advanced Materials.Smaller components, bigger errors\"The smallest transistors today are only a few nanometers in size,\" says Michael Waltl from the Institute for Microelectronics at TU Wien. \"So one has advanced to the atomic scale.\" But transistors are never perfect at the atomic level: Sometimes an atom may be in the wrong place, and sometimes the connection between two different crystals is not quite exact.\"In larger components, such errors do not play such a dominant [role]. But with tiny transistors in the order of a few nanometers, even a single defect can lead to the transistor's characteristic curves being far outside the specified tolerance range. Thus, it is considered unusable,\" Waltl continues.The effect of material defects in electronic components is usually recorded statistically in the industry: Tens of thousands of transistors are manufactured and measured. Based on the variability determined in this way, one can then calculate whether these transistors are usable or whether one must adjust the geometry or production process and reduce the number of defects. In the worst case, one would then have to increase the area of the chip, for example. This can hurt the chip's performance and increase its price.\"Just looking for transistors with properties outside the desired parameter range is an oversimplified view,\" says Waltl. \"After all, the transistors are connected to form an electronic circuit—for example, an inverter that inverts a signal or memory consisting of six transistors. The interesting question is not whether a single transistor meets certain abstract criteria when faults occur at the atomic level, but whether the entire circuit behaves correctly.\"The microelectronics team at TU Wien approached this question with a combination of experiments and computer simulations. Numerous electronic components were examined, and elaborate computer models were created based on the results.Precise computer models make it possible to design robust circuitsIt turns out that even transistors with errors are not necessarily useless. \"The fault tolerance depends on the circuit—which should be considered when designing the circuits,\" says Waltl. \"It may be, for example, that the transistor must be particularly low-fault at a particular point in the electronic circuit but that the tolerances are greater for another transistor in the same circuit.\" In such a case, two different types of transistors could be used to ensure that the circuit performs its task reliably.\"Our results apply to silicon transistors and novel 2D semiconductors,\" Waltl clarifies. \"Whatever technology you want to use to create the next generation of chips with even smaller components: In any case, the effect of unavoidable errors should not only be described empirically, as has been the case up to now, but one should resort to advanced physical computational models to simulate partial circuits or entire circuits to get the best out of the new possibilities.\"", "abstract": "近日，由奥地利维也纳科技大学领导的研究团队发现晶体管层面的缺陷会对二维集成电子电路产生影响。几十年来，作为计算机芯片核心的晶体管已经变得越来越小。因此，许多设备中的电子元件可以做得更紧凑，更快，也更强大。但这种发展是否会自然停止?组件越小，原子结构中的个别缺陷将显著改变组件行为的危险就越大。在这项新研究中，该团队着眼于电子电路层面的缺陷影响，他们发现晶体管在原子水平上并不是完美的：有时一个原子可能在错误的位置，有时两个不同晶体之间的连接不太精确。在较大的组件中，这种错误不会产生重要影响。但是对于几纳米量级的微型晶体管，即使是一个缺陷也会导致晶体管的特性曲线远远超出指定的公差范围。不过，有误差的晶体管也不一定毫无用处。该团队通过结合实验和计算机模拟来解决这个问题。研究人员检查了许多电子元件，并根据结果创建了复杂的计算机模型。该研究创建的精确的计算机模型使得设计可靠的电子电路成为可能，研究结果还适用于硅晶体管和新型二维半导体。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-defects-2d-electronic-circuits.html"}, {"title": "加拿大开发出具有多种用途的新型超高速单像素相机", "keyword": "扫描聚合模式 单像素成像 新型超高速单像素相机 数字微镜器件 ", "content_zh": "一种新的超快多用途摄像机在国家科学研究学院(INRS)的Nergie Matériaux Télé通信研究中心的实验室里，梁金阳教授和他的同事正在开发一种新的超高速单像素摄像机。这种新设备被称为通过扫描聚合模式加速的单像素成像（SPI-ASAP）可以通过光调制以每秒12000帧的速度流式传输视频，具有很大的灵活性。 这项工作发表在《自然·通讯》杂志上，代表了超高速单像素成像的突破。“这种新相机是一种创新的原型，对魁北克和加拿大其他地区的光子学行业有潜在的好处，”梁博士说，他是一名专门研究超快成像和生物光子学的研究员，也是这项研究的相应作者。多年来，梁金阳教授一直专注于新光学成像设备中的激光调制技术的研究。 单像素成像(SPI)是一种利用光调制和单点探测器代替二维传感器的强大技术。 然而，大多数SPI系统受限于仅使用数字微镜器件(DMD)，这意味着单像素相机记录图像的速度只有几十赫兹。其他方法使用快速移动的物理编码掩模进行光调制。 虽然速度很快，但这些掩模也固定了分辨率，使这种系统难以适应不同的实验参数。与这些方法相反，由INRS科学家开发的新相机将数字微镜设备与激光扫描相结合，用于快速和可重构的模式投影。 这使得该系统可以在不同的空间分辨率以及不同的成像速度和模式下工作。 因此，它能够以每秒100帧（fps）的速度流式传输实时视频，离线可达12000 fps。该论文的第一作者、INRS的博士生帕特里克·基尔卡伦（Patrick Kilcullen）表示：“以100 fps的速度实时成像的能力超越了现有技术，并为许多需要现场分析和在线反馈的工业应用提供了光明。”广泛应用另一个特点是该系统非常通用，可以很容易地适应许多配置。科学上，该设备可以有广泛的应用，尤其是在不可见的光谱中， 因为没有合适的照相机。 超高速成像允许捕捉瞬态事件，如燃烧现象的分析、危险气体的检测和半导体材料的表征。 学生Patrick Kilcullen和教授Tsuneyuki Ozaki和Jinyang Liang已经申请了这项技术的专利，目前正在寻求合作将其商业化。 ", "content_en": "A new ultrafast camera with multiple applicationsIn their laboratory at the ?nergie Matériaux Télécommunications Research Centre of the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), Professor Jinyang Liang and his colleagues are developing a new ultrahigh-speed single-pixel camera.This new device, called single-pixel imaging accelerated via swept aggregate patterns (SPI-ASAP) is capable of streaming video at 12,000 frames per second using light modulation, giving it great flexibility.

Single-pixel imaging (SPI) has emerged as a powerful technique using light modulation and a single-point detector instead of a two-dimensional sensor. However, most SPI systems are limited by the sole use of digital micromirror devices (DMDs) which means that the speed at which the single-pixel camera can record images is only a few tens of hertz.Other methods use fast-moving physical encoding masks for light modulation. Although fast, these masks also fix the resolution, making such systems inflexible to be adapted to different experimental parameters.In contrast to these approaches, the new camera developed by scientists at INRS combines a digital micromirror device with laser scanning for fast and reconfigurable pattern projection. This allows the system to operate at different spatial resolutions, as well as at different imaging speeds and modes. As a result, it is capable of streaming real-time video at 100 frames per second (fps), and up to 12,000 fps offline.\"The ability to image in real-time at 100 fps surpasses existing technologies and sheds light on many industrial applications where on-site analysis and online feedback are needed,\" says Patrick Kilcullen, first author of the paper and a doctoral student at INRS.Broad applicationsAnother feature is that the system is very generic and can be easily adapted to many configurations.Scientifically, the device could have broad applications, especially in the non-visible spectrum, as there is no suitable camera.

For example, the productivity of UV LEDs and lasers emitting in the UV, violet and blue could be enhanced by growing much of the device on GaN or AlN templates coated with thick layers of n-type AlGaN, added by HVPE.What's more, SCIOCS technology could open the door to relaxed, n-type, free-standing AlGaN substrates. This could slash the substantial series resistance in UV LEDs and lasers, stemming from the use of n-type AlGaN cladding layers that are very thin, in order to avoid issues associated with the critical thickness. Ensuring a far lower series resistance would deliver a tremendous hike in the output power of UV LEDs and enable CW operation of UV lasers, thanks to suppressed self-heating.Free-standing AlGaN substrates could also aid wide bandgap HEMTs. This foundation could quash unwanted impurities and address issues associated with device instability.Note that it's not possible to reach the growth rates realized by HVPE by simply accelerating MOCVD. The latter technique, widely employed throughout the compound semiconductor industry for chip production, is limited to around 1 ?m/hr. Higher growth rates would fail to suppress the vapour-phase reaction, even under low reactor pressures.The success by SCIOS has drawn on its previous breakthroughs, including the growth of highly pure, highly uniform GaN layers by HVPE. However, using HVPE to extend the growth from GaN to AlGaN is far from easy, according to team spokesman Hajime Fujikura, with efforts stymied by rather complicated chemical reactions. “One needs a huge number of growth trials to reach good results.”Another barrier to success is the lack of standardisation of HVPE systems. “HVPE systems are completely different from one another,” remarked Fujikura, “so it is very difficult to reproduce HVPE growth results by reading papers from other groups.”Fujikura believes that the foundation behind the team's success is the HVPE machine and its accompanying growth technology for producing free-standing GaN, using extreme gas flow-control. “This excellent growth tool is also very helpful for developing good AlGaN growth conditions.”The engineers from SCIOCS developed their AlGaN technology by studying the growth of this ternary on three different templates: 4 ?m-thick GaN on flat sapphire; 0.5 ?m-thick AlN on flat sapphire; and 0.5 ?m-thick AlN on patterned sapphire, which featured an array of 400 nm-high cones.Using aluminium, gallium and HCl as starting materials, Fujikura and colleagues produced a range of samples with aluminium fractions spanning less than 10 percent to more than 90 percent, at growth rates typically varying from around 0.1 ?m min-1 to 1 ?m min-1.During the study the team found that to ensure a high-quality surface, they had to use etching to supress parasitic reactions. These unwanted reactions might originate from parasitically crystallised AlGaN on the HVPE nozzle and the reactor wall, or from direct nucleation of irregular microcrystals on the epitaxial surface.One of the highlights of the work by the team is a 10 ?m-thick, fully-relaxed Al0.17Ga0.83N layer with a mirror-like surface, grown on the GaN-on-sapphire template. Its crystal quality is not severely deteriorated by heteroepitaxy, according to X-ray diffraction.

It is the first standalone wearable device that allows the sensor to operate independently—without any wired or wireless connection to external devices—to directly visualize the result of the measurement.This fully-integrated soft skin patch is reported in a paper published Oct. 6 in Nature Electronics, reflecting the new state-of-the-art of wearable sensors.The unique design of this small disk-shaped patch includes all the essential components that are required for wearable sensors: two integrated batteries, a microcontroller, sensors, the circuit, and a stretchable display. This covers all functionalities essential for operating a wearable sensor, from powering up to showing the user the results.\"We are trying to address the issue of practicality in wearable technologies,\" said co-first author Lu Yin, a nanoengineering postdoctoral researcher at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. \"We have seen so many inventions of wearable sensors with great novelty but with limited practicality.\"An assembly of engineering endeavorsAll the components and interconnections, except the microcontroller, are fabricated using customized elastomeric inks, which can be printed using low-cost and high-throughput screen printing onto stretchable polymer sheets.\"This requires every trade of engineering to come together,\" said Yin. \"You need experts in sensors, displays, batteries, circuit designs, firmware engineering, to get every module within this small patch to work. The integration of them also requires the knowledge in electrochemistry, electronic engineering, and material science, to ensure that all parts remain stretchable, reliable, and compatible to work seamlessly together as a system.\"The fabrication of the device involves the formulation of nine types of different stretchable inks, which were used to print the batteries, circuits, display panel, and sensors. The device is printed layer-by-layer onto stretchable polymer sheets and then assembled with hydrogels and microcontroller chips into the complete device. Each ink was optimized to ensure its compatibility with other layers while balancing its electrical, chemical, and mechanical performance.In the study, the researchers have stress-tested each component of the system, making sure that the display, sensors, and batteries can be stretched for up to 20% over 1500 cycles with little to no effects on their performance. The batteries were also packed with enough power to make sure the patch can last over a week of non-stop usage.To showcase the wide application possibilities of this patch, the researchers demonstrated four different types of sensors that work with this patch: a sodium sensor, a pH sensor, a lactate sensor, and a glucose sensor. Each sensor type measured different metrics in the sweat during exercise.\"Adding the flexible display and stretchable battery has a tremendous impact toward practical epidermal microscale sensing platforms,\" said UC San Diego nanoengineering professor Joseph Wang. He is a senior author on the new paper and co-director of the UC San Diego Center for Wearable Sensors.The research team also included a fluidic channel made of adhesives, to adhere the patch to the skin and guide the sweat to flow across the sensor. A small switch mechanism was included on the patch, and the concentration of the chemical being measured will instantly show on the display as soon as the user presses the switch.Rapid visualization on a wearable screenTo visualize the data from the sensors, the authors designed a special type of non-light-emitting display called electrochromic display. The electrochromic display technology uses materials that change color upon applying an electrical pulse, which has very low power consumption.\"It is a relatively new technology which you see now in color-changing windows in buildings and on some airplanes. But the challenge is to make it compatible with the soft, stretchable form factor in the rest of the patch,\" said Yin. \"Typical electrochromic displays require transparent glass panels with a conductive but brittle coating, which does not work for our device.\"Instead, the researchers turned to a special polymer called PEDOT:PSS, which is both conductive and has electrochromic properties. The polymer changes from light sky blue to dark navy blue when applying a negative voltage, and turns back when applying a positive voltage. By tuning the ink formulation with PEDOT:PSS, we can make it both printable and stretchable.\"The researchers designed a display panel composed of 10 individual pixels, which is programmed to display the concentration of the chemicals by turning on different numbers of the pixel. After optimizing the operation condition of the display, each pixel can be turned on and off reversibly over 10,000 cycles, more than sufficient for its week-long operation.The pixels only take 500 ms to change color, during which time they consume on average 80 microwatts of power. As it requires no power to maintain the displayed result, the display is very energy efficient for its application.Next StepsCurrently, the patch is not rechargeable and works with one sensor at a time. The team aims to develop a more advanced version of the integrated sensor, which allows the battery to be rechargeable, and can even harvest energy from the body, to extend the lifetime of the wearable patch. Skin-worn multiplexed sensors—measuring simultaneously multiple biomarkers—can also be added to the system to provide a comprehensive view of the physiological status of the user.\"This is a big step forward in developing wearable electronics that are practical and user-friendly, but this is just a start,\" Yin commented.", "abstract": "近日，美国加利福尼亚大学圣地亚哥分校的研究人员开发出了一种柔性汗液传感器，只需手指按一下即可显示出佩戴者汗液中葡萄糖、乳酸、钠或pH值的水平。该传感器的小型盘状贴片由两块集成电池、一个微控制器、传感器、电路和一个可拉伸的显示器组成，除微控制器外的所有组件和互连都是使用定制的弹性墨水制成，研究人员使用了九种不同的可拉伸墨水印刷电池、电路、显示面板和传感器。目前，该设备还不能充电，只能一次与一个传感器配合使用。未来，该团队将开出发更先进的集成传感器版本让设备可以使用电池充电，甚至可以从人体内收集能量，用来延长可穿戴贴片的使用寿命。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-standalone-sensor-readout.html"}, {"title": "瑞士研发出转换效率达22%的柔性太阳能电池", "keyword": "柔性太阳能电池 半导体 柔性聚合物基板", "content_zh": "EMPA研究人员又一次提高了CIGS柔性太阳能电池的效率，其效率达到了22.2%。 独立认证的测量显示，将光转化为电的功率转换效率为22.2%，比之前21.4%的记录有所提高。相比之下，刚性晶体硅太阳能电池的最佳效率为26.7%。 以Ayodhya N.Tiwari为首的EMPA薄膜和光伏实验室组长Romain Carron团队于2022年9月26日在意大利米兰举行的第八届世界光伏能源转换会议(WCPEC-8)上展示了他们的最新结果。这些柔性太阳能电池是在聚合物薄膜上加工的，带有Cu(In，Ga)Se2半导体层，该层吸收了通过低温共蒸发方法沉积的光。 EMPA科学家Shiro Nishiwaki修改了层的组成，以提高器件性能和输出电压。罗曼·卡伦（Romain Carron）表示：“我们探索了两种方法来合金化晶体，以提高器件性能。” 因此，研究结果可以在不同的实施之后在工业规模上转移，并具有相同的结果。 太阳能电池效率为22.2%是在德国弗赖堡的弗劳恩霍夫太阳能系统研究所独立测量的。创造了23年的新纪录。萨约迪亚·蒂瓦里和他的团队对柔性薄膜太阳能电池的研究已经超过23年了。 凭借对技术和基本物理过程的深厚知识，他们多年来创下了几项效率记录。他们的“记录系列”始于1999年的12.8%，后来分别为14.1%(2005)、17.6%(2010)、18.7%(2011)、20.4%(2013)，最近的进展是2019年的20.8%，2021年的21.4%。 在高效率限制的制度下，每一个微小的增量都需要仔细研究限制性能的因素，并需要创新的方法来克服挑战。 目前效率的提高归因于对吸光半导体层进行合金化以改善电子性能。采用这种技术的柔性和轻质太阳能组件特别适合于建筑、温室、车辆、飞艇和便携式电子设备的屋顶和立面。 EMPA与瑞士Flisom公司合作，为此类应用生产轻质柔性太阳能组件。 这项研究得到了瑞士联邦能源办公室(SFOE)的支持。 ", "content_en": "Flexible solar cells with record efficiency of 22.2%Empa researchers have, once again, improved the efficiency of CIGS flexible solar cells.

This is particularly important for portable powered displays such as smartwatches and augmented-reality/virtual-reality (AR/VR) displays which cannot accommodate large batteries.Existing VR and AR headsets use liquid-crystal displays (LCD) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, which lack brightness, resolution, power efficiency and lifetime. Efforts to establish micro-LED manufacturing use physical transfer of LEDs from the wafer upon which they are manufactured to the TFT display backplane, where they must be laser welded to the contact pad of the transistor to make an electrical connection.For high-resolution displays, millions of tiny LEDs need to be transferred from one place to another, so the potential for placement error is large. If a 99.9% placement yield is achieved, then a full-HD color display will have over 6000 faulty sub-pixel LEDs that would need to be identified, removed and re-attached. Once the 6000 faulty LEDs have been replaced, a 99.9% yield will still mean six of these will be faulty, so the task of manufacturing a perfect display is not yet finished. It is the process of seeking out the faults and then replacing them one by one which is slowing down commercialization of this new type of display.SmartKem says that its patented core chemistry allows its semiconductor inks to be processed at the low temperature of 80°C. With its lower temperature, transistors can be processed directly on top of the micro-LEDs. This eliminates the mass transfer and laser welding processes, and the fabrication of OTFTs can use existing low-cost manufacturing tools currently used for LCD backplane manufacturing. This approach cannot be carried out with other types of thin-film transistors as they are processed at the much higher temperature of 300°C, which damages the micro-LEDs, and which is why you need to make them separately and then laboriously join them together one by one, notes SmartKem.", "abstract": "近日，英国电子材料和工艺技术公司SmartKem，利用有机薄膜晶体管（OTFTs）研发出首款单片微型发光二极管（LED）显示器。目前，许多电子公司正积极开发微型LED显示器，这对于智能手表和不能容纳大电池的增强现实/虚拟现实（AR/VR）显示器等便携式供电显示器尤其重要。现有VR/AR头戴设备使用液晶显示器（LCD）和有机发光二极管（OLED）显示器，它们在亮度、分辨率、功效和寿命等方面存在缺陷。构造微型LED的关键是将LED从晶圆物理转移至TFT显示器背板上，并必须用激光焊连接到晶体管接触上，以实现电气连接。在新研究中，该公司的核心技术允许其半导体墨水在80℃的低温下完成加工。由于温度较低，晶体管可直接在微型LED上进行加工，消除了转移和激光焊接过程的影响。新技术有望加速微型LED技术的推广和应用。", "link": "https://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2023/jan/smartkem-130123.shtml"}, {"title": "韩国研发出可延长钠离子电池寿命的新型碳质阳极", "keyword": "钠离子电池 电池寿命 碳质阳极 喹吖啶酮 有机颜料", "content_zh": "与伊利诺伊大学香槟分校合作的釜山国立大学声称，韩国和美国的救生筏研究人员开发了一种钠离子电池阳极，这种阳极在1000次充放电循环后仍能储存能量。虽然钠比锂便宜，钠离子电池理论上可以储存大量能量，但潜在的电极材料不足以应对储存足够的钠离子而不被如此大的原子运动破坏的挑战--石墨被认为是不可能的， 例如。釜山阳极是含碳（“碳质”），具有理想的属性，如间隔良好的无组织碳和某些辅助原子，由精心选择的起始材料--在这种情况下是染料--热改性（“热解”）制成。“有机颜料，如喹吖啶酮，有各种各样的结构和官能团，”釜山教授Seung Geol Lee说。 “因此，它们发展出不同的热分解行为和微观结构。 裂解奎吖啶酮作为储能材料的前驱体，可以极大地改变二次电池的性能。 因此，通过控制有机颜料前体的结构来实现高效电池是可能的。“Pusannationalu钠离子阳极化学团队选择了2，9-DMQA(2，9-二甲基喹吖啶酮），它的分子在新鲜时平行堆积，并保持了一个3D结构，当热解时钠离子可以到达。 在加热过程中，普通的未取代的喹吖啶酮形成对比团块。该团队说，由于可以获得，加热产生了高无序的碳含量，以及通过插入石墨层来改善离子调节的氮和氧基团，同时促进了表面氧化还原反应和表面吸附--允许它在5mA/g下储存290mAh/g，200次循环后在100mAh/g下储存247mAh/g，1000次循环后在5A/g下储存134mAh/g。这项工作在《化学工程杂志》上发表为“钠离子电池阳极的纵向生长热解喹吖啶酮”--只有限量版免费提供。 ", "content_en": "Novel carbonaceous anodes prolong sodium ion battery lifeResearchers from Korea and USA have developed an anode for sodium-ion batteries which can still store energy after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles, claims Pusan National University, which worked with the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.While sodium is cheaper than lithium, and sodium ion cells can theoretically store plenty of energy, potential electrode materials are not proving equal to the challenge of storing sufficient sodium ions without being broken by the movement of such large atoms – graphite is thought a non-starter, for example.The Pusan anodes are carbon-containing (‘carbonaceous’) with desirable attributes such as well-spaced disorganised carbon and certain helper atoms, made by heat-modifying (‘pyrolysing’) carefully chosen starter materials – specific quinacridones in this case, which are dyes.“Organic pigments such as quinacridones have a variety of structures and functional groups,” said Pusan professor Seung Geol Lee. “As a result, they develop different thermal decomposition behaviours and microstructures.

Thus, there is a need for thermal diffusion materials that are thin and flexible and can be implemented in thin-film devices for efficient heat dissipation.Currently, several substrate materials can act as heat diffusers as thin films, but most diffuse heat in the in-plane direction isotropically. This, in turn, could create thermal interference with neighboring components of a device.\"For a substrate on which multiple devices are mounted in high density, it is necessary to control the direction of thermal diffusion and find an effective heat removal path while thermally insulating between the devices. The development of substrate films with high anisotropy in in-plane thermal conductivity is, therefore, an important target,\" explains Junior Associate Professor Kojiro Uetani from Tokyo University of Science (TUS) in Japan, who researches advanced materials for thermal conductivity and formerly belonged to SANKEN (The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research), Osaka University.In a recent study published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, Dr. Uetani and his team, comprising Assistant Professor Shota Tsuneyasu from National Institute of Technology, Oita College, and Prof. Toshifumi Satoh from Tokyo Polytechnic University, both in Japan, reported a newly developed nanocomposite film made of cellulose nanofibers and carbon fiber-fillers that demonstrated excellent in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity.Many polymer composites with thermally conductive fillers have been proposed to enhance thermal conductivity. However, there are few reports on materials with particulate or plate-like fillers that exhibit thermal conductivity anisotropy, which is important to prevent thermal interference between adjacent devices. Fibrous fillers such as carbon fibers (CF), on the other hand, can provide in-plane anisotropy in two-dimensional materials due to their structural anisotropy.It is also important to select a matrix with high thermal conductivity. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) extracted from the mantle of ascidians has been reported to exhibit higher thermal conductivity (about 2.5 W/mK) than conventional polymers, making it suitable for use as a heat-dissipating material. As indicated by the ability to write with a pencil on paper, cellulose has a high affinity for carbon materials and is easy to combine with CF fillers. For example, hydrophobic CF cannot be dispersed in water by itself, but in the presence of CNF, it is easily dispersed in water. Accordingly, the team chose bio-based ascidian—sea squirt—derived CNFs as the matrix.For material synthesis, the team prepared an aqueous suspension of CFs and CNFs and then used a technique called liquid 3D patterning. The process resulted in a nanocomposite consisting of a cellulose matrix with uniaxially aligned carbon fibers. To test the thermal conductivity of the films, the team used laser-spot periodic heating radiation thermometry method.They found that the material showed a high in-plane thermal conductivity anisotropy of 433% along with conductivity of 7.8 W/mK in the aligned direction and 1.8 W/mK in the in-plane orthogonal direction. They also installed a powder electroluminescent (EL) device on a CF/CNF film to demonstrate the effective heat dissipation. In addition, the nanocomposite film could cool two closely placed pseudo heat sources without any thermal interference.Apart from the excellent thermal properties, another major advantage of the CF/CNF films is their recyclability. The researchers were able to extract the CFs by burning the cellulose matrix, allowing to be reused. Overall, these findings can not only act as a framework for designing 2D films with novel heat dissipating patterns but also encourage sustainability in the process. \"The waste that we humans generate has a huge environmental impact. Heat transfer fillers, in particular, are often specialized and expensive materials. As a result, we wanted to create a material that does not go to waste after usage but can be recovered and reused for further applications,\" concludes Dr. Uetani.", "abstract": "近日，日本东京理科大学研究人员开发出一种能提升电子产品散热性能的新型纳米复合薄膜。这种薄膜由纤维素纳米纤维和碳纤维制成，由于纤维素纳米纤维比传统聚合物具有更高的热导率，使其可以表现出较好的平面各向异性导热性能。在材料合成过程中，研究人员制备了碳纤维和纤维素纳米纤维的水悬浮液，然后使用了一种称为液体三维图案化的技术，利用该技术产生了由纤维素基体和单轴排列的碳纤维组成的纳米复合材料。为了测试该薄膜的导热性，研究人员使用了激光点周期性加热辐射测温法，他们发现该材料显示出高达443%的面内热导率各向异性，以及在排列方向上7.8 W/mK的热导率和在面内正交方向上1.8 W/mK的热导率。此外，研究人员还发现纳米复合膜可以在不产生任何热干扰的情况下冷却两个距离很近的热源。除了优异的热性能外，这种薄膜还可以重复回收使用。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-09-nanocomposite-boost-dissipation-thin-electronics.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出可快速屏蔽电磁干扰的薄膜设备", "keyword": "喷涂 电磁辐射 二维过渡金属碳化物 氮化物 碳氮化物", "content_zh": "用开关的翻转来阻挡无线电波和电磁干扰德雷克塞尔大学工程学院的研究人员开发了一种通过喷涂制造的薄膜器件，可以用开关的翻转来阻挡电磁辐射。 这项突破是由名为MXeNes的多功能二维材料实现的，可以调整电子设备的性能，加强无线连接，并保护移动通信免受入侵。由著名大学博士、德雷克塞尔工程学院巴赫教授尤里·戈戈茨（Yury Gogotsi）领导的团队此前证明，十多年前发现的二维分层MXene材料，与电解质溶液结合后，可以成为抵御电磁波的有效屏蔽体。这项最新的MXene发现，发表在《自然纳米技术》上， 展示了当施加小于碱性电池产生的电压时，这种屏蔽是如何调节的。“电磁波干扰的动态控制对于保护工作在千兆赫频率的电子设备和各种其他通信技术来说是一个重大的技术挑战，”戈戈茨说。“随着工业和私营部门使用的无线设备数量在过去十年中以数量级的速度增加，这一挑战的紧迫性也相应增加。 这就是为什么我们的发现--它将动态地减轻电磁干扰对这些设备的影响--可能会产生广泛的影响。“Mxene是一种独特的材料，因为它具有高度的导电性--使它非常适合反射可能导致静电、反馈或降低通信设备性能的微波辐射--但它的内部化学结构也可以暂时改变，以允许这些电磁波通过。这意味着设备或电子部件上的薄涂层既可以防止它们发射电磁波，也可以防止它们被其他电子设备发射的电磁波穿透。 消除来自内部和外部来源干扰的可能性可以确保设备的性能，但当它被用于通信时，必须允许一些波进出。“如果无法控制设备内部和周围电磁波的消长，这有点像漏水的水龙头--你并没有真正关掉水，持续滴水是不好的，”戈特西说。 “我们的屏蔽确保管道紧密--可以说--在我们想使用该设备之前，没有电磁辐射泄漏或进入。”获得MXene屏蔽性能双向可调谐性的关键是利用离子的流动和驱逐来交替扩大和压缩材料层间的空间，就像手风琴一样，并改变MXene的表面化学。通过对薄膜施加一个小电压，离子进入--或插入--MXene层之间，改变其表面的电荷，并引发静电吸引，这有助于改变层间距， 材料的导电性和屏蔽效率。 当离子脱层时，电流关闭，MXENE层回到原始状态。该团队测试了10种不同的MXENE电解质组合，每种组合通过油漆喷雾器涂在比人类头发薄30到100倍的层上。 这些材料在阻挡微波辐射时始终表现出屏蔽效率的动态可调性，这是传统金属如铜和钢所不可能做到的。 Gogotsi和他的合著者写道：“这些结果表明，Mxene薄膜可以通过电化学氧化Mxenes从电磁干扰屏蔽转变为准电磁波传输。” “MXENE薄膜有可能用作动态EMI屏蔽开关。”对于安全应用，Gogotsi建议MXENE屏蔽可以隐藏设备，使其免受雷达或其他跟踪系统的检测。 该小组还测试了单向屏蔽开关的潜力。 这将使设备在部署使用之前保持不可检测，并免受未经授权的访问。“单向开关可以打开保护，并允许在紧急情况下或需要的时刻发送信号或打开通信，”戈戈茨说。 “这意味着它可以保护通信设备在使用前不受影响或篡改。例如，它可以在运输或储存期间包围设备，然后只有在设备准备使用时才激活。”戈戈茨团队的下一步是探索额外的MXene-电解质组合和机制来微调屏蔽，以实现更强的电磁波传输调制和动态调整屏蔽 ", "content_en": "Blocking radio waves and electromagnetic interference with the flip of a switchResearchers in Drexel University's College of Engineering have developed a thin film device, fabricated by spray coating, that can block electromagnetic radiation with the flip of a switch. The breakthrough, enabled by versatile two-dimensional materials called MXenes, could adjust the performance of electronic devices, strengthen wireless connections and secure mobile communications against intrusion.The team, led by Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished University and Bach professor in Drexel's College of Engineering, previously demonstrated that the two-dimensional layered MXene materials, discovered just over a decade ago, when combined with an electrolyte solution, can be turned into a potent active shield against electromagnetic waves.This latest MXene discovery, reported in Nature Nanotechnology, shows how this shielding can be tuned when a small voltage—less than that produced by an alkaline battery—is applied.\"Dynamic control of electromagnetic wave jamming has been a significant technological challenge for protecting electronic devices working at gigahertz frequencies and a variety of other communications technologies,\" Gogotsi said.\"As the number of wireless devices being used in industrial and private sectors has increased by orders of magnitude over the past decade, the urgency of this challenge has grown accordingly. This is why our discovery—which would dynamically mitigate the effect of electromagnetic interference on these devices—could have a broad impact.\"MXene is a unique material in that it is highly conductive—making it perfectly suited for reflecting microwave radiation that could cause static, feedback or diminish the performance of communications devices—but its internal chemical structure can also be temporarily altered to allow these electromagnetic waves to pass through.This means that a thin coating on a device or electrical components prevents them from both emitting electromagnetic waves, as well as being penetrated by those emitted by other electronics. Eliminating the possibility of interference from both internal and external sources can ensure the performance of the device, but some waves must be allowed to exit and enter when it is being used for communication.\"Without being able to control the ebb and flow of electromagnetic waves within and around a device, it's a bit like a leaky faucet—you're not really turning off the water and that constant dripping is no good,\" Gogotsi said. \"Our shielding ensures the plumbing is tight—so-to-speak—no electromagnetic radiation is leaking out or getting in until we want to use the device.\"The key to eliciting bidirectional tunability of MXene's shielding property is using the flow and expulsion of ions to alternately expand and compress the space between material's layers, like an accordion, as well as to change the surface chemistry of MXenes.With a small voltage applied to the film, ions enter—or intercalate—between the MXene layers altering the charge of their surface and inducing electrostatic attraction, which serves to change the layer spacing, the conductivity and shielding efficiency of the material. When the ions are deintercalated, as the current is switched off, the MXene layers return to their original state.The team tested 10 different MXene-electrolyte combinations, applying each via paint sprayer in a layer about 30 to 100 times thinner than a human hair. The materials consistently demonstrated the dynamic tunability of shielding efficiency in blocking microwave radiation, which is impossible for traditional metals like copper and steel. And the device sustained the performance through more than 500 charge-discharge cycles.\"These results indicate that the MXene films can convert from electromagnetic interference shielding to quasi-electromagnetic wave transmission by electrochemical oxidation of MXenes,\" Gogotsi and his co-authors wrote. \"The MXene film can potentially serve as a dynamic EMI shielding switch.\"For security applications, Gogotsi suggests that the MXene shielding could hide devices from detection by radar or other tracing systems. The team also tested the potential of a one-way shielding switch. This would allow a device to remain undetectable and protected from unauthorized access until it is deployed for use.\"A one-way switch could open the protection and allow a signal to be sent or communication to be opened in an emergency or at the required moment,\" Gogotsi said. \"This means it could protect communications equipment from being influenced or tampered with until it is in use. For example, it could encase the device during transportation or storage and then activate only when it is ready to be used.\"The next step for Gogotsi's team is to explore additional MXene-electrolyte combinations and mechanisms to fine-tune the shielding to achieve a stronger modulation of electromagnetic wave transmission and dynamic adjustment to block radiation at a variety of bandwidths.", "abstract": "近日，美国德雷克塞尔大学工程学院通过喷涂制造出一种只需轻按开关即可阻挡电磁辐射的薄膜设备。该研究以二维过渡金属碳化物、氮化物和碳氮化物 (MXenes)材料实现，可调整电子设备性能，并加强无线连接保护移动通信免受入侵。研究人员利用离子的流动交替扩展和压缩材料层之间的空间，并在薄膜上施加电压，控制MXene材料的性能。当离子进入或嵌入MXene层之间时，可以改变其表面电荷并引起静电吸引，从而改变层间距、材料的导电性和屏蔽效率。当离子脱嵌时，随着电流的关闭，MXene 层会恢复到原来的状态。目前，该团队还测试10种不同的 MXene电解质组合，测试结果表明，该薄膜可以通过MXenes 的电化学氧化从电磁干扰屏蔽转变为准电磁波传输。该研究提高了通信设备的安全性，促进了通信技术的发展创新。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-blocking-radio-electromagnetic-flip.html"}, {"title": "美国在铁锗晶体内发现自发电子驻波", "keyword": "电荷密度波 铁锗晶体 磁序 磁场", "content_zh": "交织：电荷和磁性如何在Kagome中交织材料物理学家发现了一种材料，其中原子的排列方式如此阻碍电子的运动，以至于它们参与了集体舞蹈，其中它们的电子和磁性似乎以意想不到的方式竞争和合作。由莱斯大学物理学家领导的这项研究今天在线发表在《自然》杂志上。 在莱斯、橡树岭国家实验室(ORNL)、SLAC国家加速器实验室、劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室(LBNL)、华盛顿大学(UW)、普林斯顿大学和加州大学伯克利分校的实验中，研究人员对纯铁锗晶体进行了研究，发现当晶体被冷却到临界低温时，晶体内会自发出现流体电子驻波。 有趣的是，电荷密度波是在材料处于磁性状态时产生的，它在较高的温度下过渡到磁性状态。“电荷密度波通常发生在没有磁性的材料中，”该研究的共同作者、水稻的戴鹏程说。 “同时具有电荷密度波和磁性的材料实际上是罕见的。更罕见的是电荷密度波和磁性相互‘对话’的材料，就像它们在这种情况下所做的那样。”“通常，电荷密度波与磁性同时发生，或者在比磁转变更高的温度下发生，”他说。 “这个特殊的情况似乎很特殊，因为电荷密度波实际上发生在比磁性低得多的温度下。我们不知道有任何其他例子表明，这种材料实际上发生在这种以Kagome晶格为特征的材料中。这表明它可能与磁性有关。”实验中使用的铁锗晶体是在戴的实验室中生长的，其晶格中原子的独特排列让人想起在日本Kagome篮子中发现的图案。 晶格中的等边三角形迫使电子相互作用，由于它们不愿靠近彼此，这种强迫阻碍了它们的运动。 随着温度的降低，这种强迫增加，产生了像电荷密度波这样的集体行为。该研究的共同作者、也是赖斯的明义说，“电荷密度波就像海洋表面形成的波。 它只有在条件合适的时候才会形成。 在这种情况下，我们观察到，在允许电子生存的量子态中出现了一个马鞍形状的独特特征。 与磁序的联系是，这种电荷密度波只有在磁性使马鞍出现时才发生。 这是我们的假设。“这些实验提供了物理学家在量子材料中发现的属性的诱人一瞥，这些量子材料既有拓扑特征，也有强关联电子相互作用产生的特征。在拓扑材料中，量子纠缠模式产生了无法抹去的”受保护“状态。 拓扑态的不可变性是量子计算和自旋电子学研究的热点。 最早的拓扑材料是非导电绝缘体，其受保护状态允许它们以有限的方式导电，比如在二维外表面或沿一维边缘导电。“过去，拓扑材料是非常弱相关的类型，”赖斯大学物理和天文学助理教授易说。 “人们使用这些材料来真正理解量子材料的拓扑结构，但现在的挑战是找到我们可以利用拓扑态和强电子相关性的材料。”在强关联材料中，数十亿个电子的相互作用产生了集体行为，如非常规超导或量子自旋液体中磁态之间的持续涨落。“对于弱关联材料，如原始拓扑绝缘体，第一原理计算非常有效，”易说。 “只要根据原子的排列方式，你就可以计算出什么样的能带结构。从材料设计的角度来看，有一个非常好的途径。你甚至可以预测材料的拓扑结构。”“但强关联材料更具挑战性，”她说。 “理论和测量之间缺乏联系。因此，不仅很难找到既具有强相关性又具有拓扑结构的材料，而且当你找到它们并测量它们时，也很难将你测量的东西与解释发生了什么的理论模型联系起来。”易和戴说，Kagome晶格材料可以提供一条前进的道路。“在某个时候，你希望能够说，'我想制造一种具有特定行为和性质的材料，”易说。 “我认为Kagome是朝着这个方向发展的一个很好的平台，因为有方法可以直接pre ", "content_en": "Interwoven: How charge and magnetism intertwine in kagome materialPhysicists have discovered a material in which atoms are arranged in a way that so frustrates the movement of electrons that they engage in a collective dance where their electronic and magnetic natures appear to both compete and cooperate in unexpected ways.Led by Rice University physicists, the research was published online today in Nature. In experiments at Rice, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), the University of Washington (UW), Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley, researchers studied pure iron-germanium crystals and discovered standing waves of fluid electrons appeared spontaneously within the crystals when they were cooled to a critically low temperature. Intriguingly, the charge density waves arose while the material was in a magnetic state, to which it had transitioned at a higher temperature.\"A charge density wave typically occurs in materials that have no magnetism,\" said study co-corresponding author Pengcheng Dai of Rice. \"Materials that have both a charge density wave and magnetism are actually rare. Even more rare are those where the charge density wave and magnetism 'talk' to each other, as they appear to be doing in this case.\"\"Usually, the charge density wave occurs concurrently with magnetism or at a higher temperature than the magnetic transition,\" he said. \"This particular case appears to be special, because the charge density wave actually occurs at a temperature much lower than magnetism. We do not know of any other example where this actually happens in a material like this one, which features a kagome lattice. That suggests that it could be related to the magnetism.\"The iron-germanium crystals used in the experiments were grown in Dai's lab and feature a distinct arrangement of atoms in their crystal lattice that is reminiscent of the patterns found in Japanese kagome baskets. Equilateral triangles in the lattice force electrons to interact, and because they loathe to be near one another, this forcing frustrates their movements. The forcing increases as temperatures drop, giving rise to collective behaviors like the charge density wave.Study co-corresponding author Ming Yi, also of Rice, says that \"the charge density wave is like waves forming on the surface of the ocean. It only forms when the conditions are right. In this case, we observed it when a unique feature in the shape of a saddle appeared in the quantum states that the electrons are allowed to live in. The connection with magnetic order is that this charge density wave only occurs when magnetism makes the saddle appear. That is our hypothesis.\"The experiments offer a tantalizing glimpse of the properties physicists will find in quantum materials that have both topological features and those arising from strongly correlated electron interactions.In topological materials, patterns of quantum entanglement produce \"protected\" states that cannot be erased. The immutable nature of topological states is of increasing interest for quantum computing and spintronics. The earliest topological materials were non-conducting insulators whose protected states allowed them to conduct electricity in limited ways, like on 2D outer surfaces or along 1D edges.\"In the past, topological materials were types that were very weakly correlated,\" said Yi, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Rice. \"People used those materials to really understand the topology of quantum materials, but the challenge now is to find materials where we can take advantage of both topological states and strong electron correlations.\"In strongly correlated materials, the interactions of billions upon billions of electrons give rise to collective behaviors like unconventional superconductivity or the continual fluctuations between magnetic states in quantum spin liquids.\"For weakly correlated materials like the original topological insulators, first principle calculations work really well,\" Yi said. \"Just based on how the atoms are arranged, you can calculate what kind of band structure to expect. There's a really good pathway from a materials design perspective. You can even predict the topology of the materials.\"\"But strongly correlated materials are more challenging,\" she said. \"There's a lack of connection between theory and measurement. So, not only is it difficult to find materials that are both strongly correlated and topological, but when you do find them and measure them it is also very difficult to connect what you're measuring with a theoretical model that explains what's going on.\"Yi and Dai said kagome lattice materials could provide a path forward.\"At some point, you want to be able to say, 'I want to make a material with particular behaviors and properties,\" Yi said. \"I think kagome is a good platform towards that direction, because there are ways to make direct predictions, based on the crystal structure, about the kind of band structure you will get and therefore about the phenomena that can arise based on that band structure. It has many of the right ingredients.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国莱斯大学的研究人员在铁锗晶体内发现了自发的电子驻波。在实验中研究人员所使用的铁锗晶体的晶格排列非常独特，看上去非常像果篮，晶格中的等边三角形会迫使电子产生相互作用，使电子彼此排斥，阻碍其运动。当晶体冷却到临界温度时，这种强迫的程度会加剧，从而自发产生电荷密度波，这种电荷密度波与在海洋表面形成的波浪相似。研究人员在马鞍状独特特征出现在量子态中时观察到这种电荷密度波。这项研究证明了铁锗晶体既有拓扑特征，也有来自强相关电子相互作用的特征。该研究为铁锗晶体材料量子特性研究提供了一定理论基础。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-09-interwoven-magnetism-intertwine-kagome-material.html"}, {"title": "美国发现电池材料中锂离子可提高电动汽车电池材料性能", "keyword": "锂离子 活性粒子 富镍锰钴氧化物 电池退化机制", "content_zh": "实时观察锂离子可以提高电动汽车电池材料的性能研究人员发现，锂离子在下一代电池材料中的不规则运动可能会降低它们的容量，阻碍它们的性能。由剑桥大学领导的团队实时跟踪了锂离子在一种有前途的新电池材料中的运动。人们认为锂离子存储在电池材料中的机制在单个活性颗粒中是一致的。 然而，剑桥领导的团队发现，在充放电循环中，锂的存储绝不是均匀的。当电池接近放电循环结束时，活性粒子的表面被锂饱和，而它们的核心缺乏锂。 这将导致可重复使用的锂的损失和容量的降低。这项研究有助于改进现有的电池材料，并可能加速下一代电池的开发。 研究结果发表在《焦耳》上。电动汽车在向零碳经济的过渡中至关重要。 今天路上的大多数电动汽车都是由锂离子电池供电的，部分原因是它们的高能量密度。然而，随着电动汽车的使用变得更加广泛，对更长续航里程和更快充电时间的推动意味着当前的电池材料需要改进，新材料需要识别。这些材料中一些最有前途的是最先进的正极材料，称为层状富锂镍氧化物，广泛应用于优质电动汽车。 然而，它们的工作机制，特别是在实际操作条件下锂离子的传输，以及这与它们的电化学性能之间的关系，还没有完全理解，所以我们还不能从这些材料中获得最大的性能。通过在显微镜下跟踪电池运行期间光如何与活性粒子相互作用，研究人员观察到了富镍锰钴氧化物(NMC)在充放电循环中锂存储的明显差异。“这是第一次在单个粒子中直接观察到锂存储的这种不均匀性，”共同第一作者爱丽丝·梅里威瑟说， 来自剑桥大学优素福·哈米德化学系。 “像我们这样的实时技术对在电池循环过程中捕捉这一点至关重要。”结合实验观察和计算机建模，研究人员发现，这种不均匀性源于充放电循环期间锂离子在NMC中扩散速率的剧烈变化。 具体地说，锂离子在完全锂化的NMC颗粒中扩散缓慢，但一旦从这些颗粒中提取出一些锂离子，扩散就会显著增强。“我们的模型提供了在充电的早期阶段锂离子在NMC中扩散的范围，”共同第一作者、剑桥工程系的Shricidhi Pandurangi博士说。 “我们的模型准确地预测了锂的分布，并捕捉到了实验中观察到的不均匀程度。 这些预测是理解颗粒断裂等其他电池降解机制的关键。“重要的是，放电结束时看到的锂异质性为富镍正极材料在第一次充放电循环后通常损失约10%的容量提供了一个原因。”联合第一作者、上海科技大学的徐超博士说：“考虑到用于确定电池是否应该退役的一项工业标准是电池损失20%的容量，这一点意义重大。”他在剑桥完成了这项研究。 ", "content_en": "Watching lithium in real time could improve performance of EV battery materialsResearchers have found that the irregular movement of lithium ions in next-generation battery materials could be reducing their capacity and hindering their performance.The team, led by the University of Cambridge, tracked the movement of lithium ions inside a promising new battery material in real time.It had been assumed that the mechanism by which lithium ions are stored in battery materials is uniform across the individual active particles. However, the Cambridge-led team found that during the charge-discharge cycle, lithium storage is anything but uniform.When the battery is near the end of its discharge cycle, the surfaces of the active particles become saturated by lithium while their cores are lithium deficient. This results in the loss of reusable lithium and a reduced capacity.The research could help improve existing battery materials and could accelerate the development of next-generation batteries. The results are published in Joule.Electrical vehicles (EVs) are vital in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. Most electric vehicles on the road today are powered by lithium-ion batteries, due in part to their high energy density.However, as EV use becomes more widespread, the push for longer ranges and faster charging times means that current battery materials need to be improved, and new materials need to be identified.Some of the most promising of these materials are state-of-the-art positive electrode materials known as layered lithium nickel-rich oxides, which are widely used in premium EVs. However, their working mechanisms, particularly lithium-ion transport under practical operating conditions, and how this is linked to their electrochemical performance, are not fully understood, so we cannot yet obtain maximum performance from these materials.By tracking how light interacts with active particles during battery operation under a microscope, the researchers observed distinct differences in lithium storage during the charge-discharge cycle in nickel-rich manganese cobalt oxide (NMC).\"This is the first time that this non-uniformity in lithium storage has been directly observed in individual particles,\" said co-first author Alice Merryweather, from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry. \"Real time techniques like ours are essential to capture this while the battery is cycling.\"Combining the experimental observations with computer modeling, the researchers found that the non-uniformity originates from drastic changes to the rate of lithium-ion diffusion in NMC during the charge-discharge cycle. Specifically, lithium ions diffuse slowly in fully lithiated NMC particles, but the diffusion is significantly enhanced once some lithium ions are extracted from these particles.\"Our model provides insights into the range over which lithium-ion diffusion in NMC varies during the early stages of charging,\" said co-first author Dr. Shrinidhi Pandurangi from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. \"Our model predicted lithium distributions accurately and captured the degree of heterogeneity observed in experiments.

As integrated components, the thin-film sensors could eliminate the need for external spectrometers in the future. A patent application has already been filed for the novel technology. Spectroscopy comprises a group of experimental methods that decompose radiation according to a specific property, such as wavelength or mass. It is considered one of the most important analytical methods in research and industry. Spectrometers can determine colors (wavelengths) of light sources and are used as sensors in various applications, such as medicine, engineering, food industry and many more. Commercially available instruments are usually relatively large and very expensive. They are mostly based on the principle of the prism or grating: light is refracted and the wavelength is assigned according to the angle of refraction.At the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) and the Dresden Integrated Center for Applied Physics and Photonic Materials (IAPP) of the TU Dresden, such sensor components based on organic semiconductors have been researched for years. With the spin-offs Senorics and PRUUVE, two technologies have already been developed towards market maturity. Now, researchers at the IAP and IAPP, in cooperation with the Institute of Physical Chemistry, have developed a thin-film sensor that describes a completely new way of identifying the wavelength of light and, due to its small size and cost, has clear advantages over commercially available spectrometers.The principle of operation of the novel sensors is as follows: Light of unknown wavelength excites luminescent materials in a hair-thin film. The film consists of a mixture of long-glowing (phosphorescent) and short-glowing (fluorescent) entities, which absorb the light under investigation in different ways. The intensity of the afterglow, can be used to infer the wavelength of the unknown input light.\"We exploit the fundamental physics of excited states in luminescent materials,\" explains Anton Kirch, doctoral student at the IAP. \"Light of different wavelengths excites in such a system, when properly composed, certain proportions of long-lived triplet and short-lived singlet spin states. And we reverse that dependence. By identifying the spin fractions using a photodetector, we can identify light wavelengths.\"\"The great strength of our research alliance here in Dresden is our partners,\" says Prof. Sebastian Reineke, who coordinated the project. \"Together with the groups of Prof. Alexander Eychmüller from Physical Chemistry and Karl Leo, professor of Optoelectronics, we can carry out all the fabrication and analysis steps ourselves, starting with material synthesis and film processing and ending with the fabrication of the organic detector.\"Dr. Johannes Benduhn is group leader for Organic Sensors and Solar Cells at the IAP: \"I was honestly very impressed that a simple photoactive film combined with a photodetector can form such a high-resolution device.\" Using this strategy, the scientists have achieved sub-nanometer spectral resolution and have successfully tracked minor wavelength changes of light sources. In addition to characterizing light sources, the novel sensors can also be used in counterfeit protection. \"The small and inexpensive sensors could be used, for example, to quickly and reliably check banknotes or documents for certain security features and thus determine their authenticity, without any need for expensive laboratory technology,\" explains Anton Kirch.", "abstract": "近日，由德国德累斯顿大学应用物理研究所（IAP）领导的研究团队研发出一种用于光源分析和防伪的有机薄膜传感器。作为集成组件，薄膜传感器将来可消除对外部光谱仪的需要。光谱仪能确定光源的颜色（波长），并在各种应用中用作传感器，如医学、工程、食品工业等。然而，市售仪器通常相对较大且非常昂贵。为此，研究人员开发出一种薄膜传感器，由于其体积小、成本低，与商用光谱仪相比具有明显的优势。新型传感器的工作原理是用未知波长的光激发有机薄膜中的发光材料，通过余光轻度推断未知波长。有机薄膜由长发光（磷光）和短发光（荧光）材料的混合物组成，能以不同的方式吸收光。余光的强度可用来推断未知输入光的波长。利用该策略，研究人员已经实现了亚纳米光谱分辨率，并成功跟踪了光源的微小波长变化。此外，除了表征光源，该传感器还可用于防伪。该成果为光源分析设备的研发提供了新方案，推动了传感器领域的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-09-thin-film-sensors-light-source-analysis-anti-counterfeiting.html"}, {"title": "日本开发出可控充电电子蟑螂", "keyword": "电子蟑螂 太阳能电池 弹性聚合物", "content_zh": "机器人虫：由RIKEN集群开拓性研究(CPR)的研究人员领导的一个可充电、远程控制的电子蟑螂国际团队设计了一个系统，用于制造远程控制的电子蟑螂，该系统配备了一个微型无线控制模块，该模块由连接在太阳能电池上的可充电电池供电。 尽管有机械装置，超薄的电子设备和柔性材料允许昆虫自由移动。 这些成果于9月5日发表在科学杂志《新太平洋学会柔性电子》上，将有助于使电子昆虫的使用成为现实。研究人员一直试图设计电子昆虫--一部分是昆虫，一部分是机器--来帮助检查危险区域或监测环境。 然而，为了使电子昆虫的使用变得实用，操作者必须能够长时间地远程控制它们。 这需要无线控制他们的腿段，由一个微型充电电池供电。 保持电池充足的充电是根本--没有人希望突然失控的机器人蟑螂队四处游荡。 虽然可以建立扩展坞为电池充电，但返回和充电的需要可能会扰乱时间敏感的任务。 因此，最好的解决方案是安装一个车载太阳能电池，可以持续确保电池保持充电状态。所有这些说起来容易做起来难。 为了成功地将这些设备集成到表面积有限的蟑螂中，研究小组需要开发一种特殊的背包、超薄有机太阳能电池组件和一种粘附系统，该系统可以让机器长时间附着，同时允许自然移动。在Riken CPR福田健次郎的带领下，该团队用马达加斯加蟑螂进行了实验，这些蟑螂大约6厘米长。 他们用一个特别设计的背包将无线腿部控制模块和锂聚合物电池安装在昆虫的胸部顶部，这个背包是仿照模型蟑螂的身体设计的。 这个背包是用一种弹性聚合物3D打印出来的，与蟑螂的曲面完美吻合，让这个刚性的电子设备可以稳定地安装在胸腔上一个多月。超薄的0.004毫米厚的有机太阳能电池组件安装在腹部的背侧。 Fukuda说：“这种安装在身体上的超薄有机太阳能电池组件的功率输出为17.2兆瓦，比目前最先进的昆虫能量收集设备的功率输出大50多倍。”超薄灵活的有机太阳能电池，以及它是如何附着在昆虫上的，被证明是确保移动自由所必需的。 在仔细检查蟑螂的自然运动后，研究人员意识到腹部改变了形状，外骨骼部分重叠。 为了适应这一点，他们将胶粘剂和非胶粘剂部分交织到薄膜上，这允许它们弯曲但也保持附着。 当测试更厚的太阳能电池薄膜时，或者当薄膜均匀附着时，蟑螂跑同样的距离需要两倍的时间，而且在仰卧时很难扶正。一旦这些组件与刺激腿段的电线一起集成到蟑螂身上，新的电子机器人就被测试了。 电池在伪阳光下充电30分钟，使用无线遥控器让动物左右转动。福田说：“考虑到胸部和腹部在基本运动中的变形，一个由胸部刚性和柔性元件以及腹部超声波设备组成的混合电子系统似乎是机器人蟑螂的有效设计。” “而且，由于腹部变形并不是蟑螂独有的，我们的策略可以适用于甲虫等其他昆虫，或者将来甚至可以适用于蝉等飞虫。” ", "content_en": "Robo-bug: A rechargeable, remote-controllable cyborg cockroachAn international team led by researchers at the RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research (CPR) has engineered a system for creating remote controlled cyborg cockroaches, equipped with a tiny wireless control module that is powered by a rechargeable battery attached to a solar cell. Despite the mechanic devices, ultrathin electronics and flexible materials allow the insects to move freely. These achievements, reported in the scientific journal npj Flexible Electronics on September 5, will help make the use of cyborg insects a practical reality.Researchers have been trying to design cyborg insects—part insect, part machine—to help inspect hazardous areas or monitor the environment. However, for the use of cyborg insects to be practical, handlers must be able to control them remotely for long periods of time. This requires wireless control of their leg segments, powered by a tiny rechargeable battery. Keeping the battery adequately charged is fundamental—nobody wants a suddenly out-of-control team of cyborg cockroaches roaming around. While it's possible to build docking stations for recharging the battery, the need to return and recharge could disrupt time-sensitive missions. Therefore, the best solution is to include an on-board solar cell that can continuously ensure that the battery stays charged.All of this is easier said than done. To successfully integrate these devices into a cockroach that has limited surface area required the research team to develop a special backpack, ultrathin organic solar cell modules, and an adhesion system that keeps the machinery attached for long periods of time while also allowing natural movements.Led by Kenjiro Fukuda, RIKEN CPR, the team experimented with Madagascar cockroaches, which are approximately 6 cm long. They attached the wireless leg-control module and lithium polymer battery to the top of the insect on the thorax using a specially designed backpack, which was modeled after the body of a model cockroach. The backpack was 3D printed with an elastic polymer and conformed perfectly to the curved surface of the cockroach, allowing the rigid electronic device to be stably mounted on the thorax for more than a month.The ultrathin 0.004 mm thick organic solar cell module was mounted on the dorsal side of the abdomen. \"The body-mounted ultrathin organic solar cell module achieves a power output of 17.2 mW, which is more than 50 times larger than the power output of current state-of-the art energy harvesting devices on living insects,\" according to Fukuda.The ultrathin and flexible organic solar cell, and how it was attached to the insect, proved necessary to ensure freedom of movement. After carefully examining natural cockroach movements, the researchers realized that the abdomen changes shape and portions of the exoskeleton overlap. To accommodate this, they interleaved adhesive and non-adhesive sections onto the films, which allowed them to bend but also stay attached. When thicker solar cell films were tested, or when the films were uniformly attached, the cockroaches took twice as long to run the same distance, and had difficulty righting themselves when on their backs.Once these components were integrated into the cockroaches, along with wires that stimulate the leg segments, the new cyborgs were tested. The battery was charged with pseudo-sunlight for 30 minutes, and animals were made to turn left and right using the wireless remote control.\"Considering the deformation of the thorax and abdomen during basic locomotion, a hybrid electronic system of rigid and flexible elements in the thorax and ultrasoft devices in the abdomen appears to be an effective design for cyborg cockroaches,\" says Fukuda. \"Moreover, since abdominal deformation is not unique to cockroaches, our strategy can be adapted to other insects like beetles, or perhaps even flying insects like cicadas in the future.\"", "abstract": "近日，日本理化研究所研究人员设计了一个可远程控制的电子蟑螂系统。该系统配备一个微型无线控制模块，由太阳能电池供电。研究人员一直在试图设计半昆虫半机械的电子昆虫，以帮助实现环境监测。为成功将必要电子设备集成到蟑螂有限表面积上，研究人员用一种弹性聚合物材料，3D打印出了一种特殊的背包，它包括超薄有机太阳能电池模块，以及一个粘附系统使机器保持长时间连接，同时允许蟑螂自由运动。他们用长约6厘米的马达加斯加蟑螂做了实验，将无线蟑螂腿控制模块和锂电池连接到蟑螂背部，超薄的有机太阳能电池模块安装在腹部，这种超薄有机太阳能电池模块的输出功率为17.2毫瓦，比目前最先进的昆虫能量收集设备输出功率大50倍以上。该研究成果将有助于使电子昆虫的大规模使用成为现实。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-09-robo-bug-rechargeable-remote-controllable-cyborg-cockroach.html"}, {"title": "日本开发出能在微流体芯片内三维打印多个组件模块的微型机器人", "keyword": "微流体芯片 三维打印 微型机器人", "content_zh": "在微流控芯片中具有多个组件模块的3D打印微型机器人大坂大学机械工程系的科学家介绍了一种利用原位集成制造化学能驱动的复杂微型机器人的方法。 通过3D打印和在微流控芯片内组装微型机器人的机械结构和执行器，所产生的微型机器人能够执行预期的功能，如移动或抓取。 这项工作将有助于实现自主机器人进行显微手术的愿景。随着医疗技术的进步，越来越复杂的手术过去被认为是不可能的已经成为现实。 然而，我们离承诺的未来还很远，在未来，微型机器人可以通过病人的身体进行手术，如显微手术或癌细胞消除。尽管纳米技术方法已经掌握了制造微小结构的艺术，但操纵和组装这些组成部分成为功能复杂的机器人仍然是一个挑战，尤其是当试图大规模制造它们时。 因此，微小机械部件的组装、集成和重构，尤其是由化学能驱动的可移动执行器，仍然是一个困难和耗时的过程。现在，一个研究小组，包括大阪大学的森岛和王、日本高级科学技术研究所(JAIST)的平冢和岐阜大学的Nitta在内，开发了一种新的方法，用于3D打印微型机器人，在同一个微流控芯片内有多个组件模块。 软微机器人结构是通过激光照射来硬化光诱导的生物相容性水凝胶聚（乙二醇）二丙烯酸酯。“最近，微机器人的发展已经从硬和刚性结构过渡到软和柔性结构”第一作者王英哲说。 与以前的方法相比，通过在原地或现场组装不同的模块，逐步过程被简化和流线型。团队的装配线方法允许他们将各种模块，如关节、抓手或人造肌肉，组合成一个单一的设备。 不同功能的成功集成可以为各种微型机器人提供可扩展的大规模生产。 在这项工作中，研究人员展示了几种不同的类型，包括抓手、鱼和机械臂。资深作者Keisuke Morishima说：“我们在原位集成了驱动器和机械结构，提高了微型机器人制造的灵活性和效率，这可能有助于实现目前大规模生产的难题。” 除了医疗保健应用，这些机器人还可以通过充当微流控阀或机械手来帮助制造更复杂的机器人。 ", "content_en": "3D-printing microrobots with multiple component modules inside a microfluidic chipScientists from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Osaka University introduced a method for manufacturing complex microrobots driven by chemical energy using in situ integration. By 3D-printing and assembling the mechanical structures and actuators of microrobots inside a microfluidic chip, the resulting microrobots were able to perform desired functions, like moving or grasping. This work may help realize the vision of microsurgery performed by autonomous robots.As medical technology advances, increasingly complicated surgeries that were once considered impossible have become reality. However, we are still far away from a promised future in which microrobots coursing through a patient's body can perform procedures, such as microsurgery or cancer cell elimination.Although nanotech methods have already mastered the art of producing tiny structures, it remains a challenge to manipulate and assemble these constituent parts into functional complex robots, especially when trying to produce them at a mass scale. As a result, the assembly, integration and reconfiguration of tiny mechanical components, and especially movable actuators driven by chemical energy, remains a difficult and time-consuming process.Now, a team of researchers, including Morishima and Wang at Osaka University, Hiratsuka at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), and Nitta at Gifu University, developed a new method for 3D-printing microrobots with multiple component modules inside the same microfluidic chip.

The results are published in Nature Photonics.When the titanium-doped sapphire laser was introduced in the 1980s, it was a major advance in the field of lasers. Critical to its success was the material used as its gain medium—that is, the material that amplifies the laser's energy. Sapphire doped with titanium ions proved to be particularly powerful, providing a much wider laser emission bandwidth than conventional semiconductor lasers. The innovation led to fundamental discoveries and countless applications in physics, biology, and chemistry.The table-top titanium-sapphire laser is a must-have for many academic and industrial labs. However, the large bandwidth of this laser comes at the cost of a relatively high threshold—that is, the amount of power that it requires. As a result, these lasers are costly and take up a lot of space, largely limiting their use to laboratory research. Without overcoming this limitation, said Yubo Wang, lead author of the study and a graduate student in Tang's lab, titanium-sapphire lasers will remain limited to niche customers.The combination of the performance of titanium-sapphire lasers with the small size of a chip could drive applications that are limited by how much power or space they can consume, such as atomic clocks, portable sensors, visible light communication devices, and even quantum computing chips.To that end, the Tang lab has demonstrated the world's first titanium-doped sapphire laser integrated with a chip-scale photonic circuit, which provides the widest gain spectrum yet seen on a chip—paving the way for numerous new applications.The key is in the laser's low threshold. While conventional titanium-doped sapphire lasers have a threshold of more than 100 milliwatts, the Tang lab's system had a threshold of about 6.5 milliwatts. With further tweaking, they believe they can further reduce it to 1 milliwatt.

We've done many experiments, like making a copy of the Mona Lisa in a 12 by 16-micrometer area with a pixel size of ten nanometers. We've also printed an image of DTU's founder—Hans Christian ?rsted—in an 8 by 12-micrometer size with a pixel size of 2,540,000 DPI. To get an idea of the scale we are working at, we could write our signatures on a red blood cell with this thing,\" says Professor Peter B?ggild from DTU Physics.\"The most radical thing is that we can create free-form 3D landscapes at that crazy resolution—this gray-scale nanolithography is a true game-changer for our research.\"Nanoscale Christmas record, in stereoThe Nanofrazor is not like a printer adding material to a medium; instead, it works like a CNC (computer numerical control) machine removing material at precise locations, leaving the desired shape behind. In the case of the miniature pictures of Mona Lisa and H.C. ?rsted, the final image is defined by the line-by-line removal of polymer until a perfect gray-scale image emerges. To Peter B?ggild, an amateur musician and vinyl record enthusiast, the idea of cutting a nanoscale record was obvious.\"We decided that we might as well try and print a record. We've taken a snippet of 'Rocking Around The Christmas Tree' and have cut it just like you would cut a normal record—although, since we're working on the nanoscale, this one isn't playable on your average turntable. The Nanofrazor was put to work as a record-cutting lathe—converting an audio signal into a spiraled groove on the surface of the medium. In this case, the medium is a different polymer than vinyl.\"We even encoded the music in stereo—the lateral wriggles is the left channel, whereas the depth modulation contains the right channel. It may be too impractical and expensive to become a hit record. To read the groove, you need a rather costly atomic force microscope or the Nanofrazor, but it is definitely doable.\"High-speed, low-cost nanostructuresThe NOVO Foundation grant BIOMAG, which made the Nanofrazor dream possible, is not about cutting Christmas records or printing images of famous people. Peter B?ggild and his colleagues, Tim Booth and Nolan Lassaline, have other plans. They expect that the Nanofrazor will allow them to sculpt 3D nanostructures in extremely precise detail and do so at high speed and low cost—something that is impossible with existing tools.\"We work with 2D materials, and when these ultrathin materials are carefully laid down on the 3D landscapes, they follow the contours of the surface. In short, they curve, and that is a powerful and entirely new way of 'programming' materials to do things that no one would believe were possible just fifteen years ago. For instance, when curved in just the right way, graphene behaves as if there is a giant magnetic field when there is, in fact, none. And we can curve it just the right way with the Nanofrazor,\" says Peter B?ggild.Associate professor Tim Booth adds, \"The fact that we can now accurately shape the surfaces with nanoscale precision at pretty much the speed of imagination is a game changer for us. We have many ideas for what to do next and believe that this machine will significantly speed up the prototyping of new structures. Our main goal is to develop novel magnetic sensors for detecting currents in the living brain within the BIOMAG project. Still, we also look forward to creating precisely sculpted potential landscapes with which we can better control electron waves. There is much work to do.\"Postdoc Nolan Lassaline (who cut the Christmas record) plans to create \"quantum soap bubbles\" in graphene.

Perovskite technology can overcome these limitations, but until now, it had performed below its full potential. Our latest study identifies a key reason for this and points a way forward.\"Traditional solar cells are made from wafers of extremely high-purity silicon, which is energetically costly to produce. By contrast, perovskite solar cells are built from nano-sized crystals that can be dispersed into a liquid and spin-coated onto a surface using low-cost, well-established techniques.Another advantage of perovskites is that by adjusting the thickness and chemical composition of the crystal films, manufacturers can selectively 'tune' the wavelengths of light that get absorbed and converted into electricity, whereas silicon always absorbs the same part of the solar spectrum.In a new paper published today in Nature, the international team of researchers used two different layers of perovskite, each tuned to a different part of the solar spectrum, to produce what is known as a tandem solar cell.\"In our cell, the top perovskite layer has a wider band gap, which absorbs well in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, as well as some visible light,\" says Chongwen Li, a postdoctoral researcher in Sargent's lab and one of five co-lead authors on the new paper.\"The bottom layer has a narrow band gap, which is tuned more toward the infrared part of the spectrum. Between the two, we cover more of the spectrum than would be possible with silicon.\"The tandem design enables the cell to produce a very high open-circuit voltage, which in turn improves its efficiency. But the key innovation came when the team analyzed the interface between the perovskite layer, where light is absorbed and transformed into excited electrons, and the adjacent layer, known as the electron transport layer.\"What we found is that the electric field across the surface of the perovskite layer—we call it the surface potential—was not uniform,\" says Ph.D. student Aidan Maxwell, another co-lead author.\"The effect of this was that in some places, excited electrons were moving easily into the electron transport layer, but in others, they would just recombine with the holes they left behind. Those electrons were being lost to the circuit.\"To address this challenge, the team coated a substance known as 1,3-propanediammonium (PDA) onto the surface of the perovskite layer. Though the coating was only a few nanometers in thickness, it made a big difference.\"PDA has a positive charge, and it is able to even out the surface potential,\" says postdoctoral fellow Hao Chen, another of the co-lead authors.\"When we added the coating, we got much better energetic alignment of the perovskite layer with the electron transport layer, and that led to a big improvement on our overall efficiency.\"The team's prototype solar cell measures one square centimeter in area, and produces an open-circuit voltage of 2.19 electron volts, which is a record for all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Its power conversion efficiency was measured at 27.4%, which is higher than the current record for traditional single-junction silicon solar cells. The cell was also independently certified at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, delivering an efficiency of 26.3%.The team used industry standard methods to measure the stability of the new cell and found that it maintained 86% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours of continuous operation.\"Continuing to advance the efficiency and stability of next-generation solar cells is a crucial priority for decarbonizing the electricity supply,\" says Professor Alberto Salleo, Chair of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University, who was not involved in the study.\"The team developed a deep chemical understanding of what was limiting a crucial interface—the junction with the electron-extracting layer—in the large-bandgap portion of perovskite solar cells. These insights from basic science, acted on with innovative materials engineering strategies, will continue to drive the field forward.\"The researchers will now focus on further enhancing efficiency by increasing the current that runs through the cell, improving stability, and enlarging the area of the cell so that it can be scaled up to commercial proportions.The identification of the key role played by the interfaces between layers also points the way toward potential future improvements.\"In this work, we've focused on the interface between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer, but there is another important layer that extracts the 'holes' those electrons leave behind,\" says Sargent.\"One of the intriguing things in my experience with this field is that learning to master one interface doesn't necessarily teach you the rules for mastering the other interfaces. I think there's lots more discovery to be done.\"Maxwell says that the ability of perovskite technology to hold its own against silicon, even though the latter has had a multi-decade head start, is encouraging.\"In the last ten years, perovskite technology has come almost as far as silicon has in the last 40,\" he says. \"Just imagine what it will be able to do in another ten years.\"", "abstract": "近日，加拿大多伦多大学开发出具有极高效率的全钙钛矿叠层太阳能电池。研究人员使用两层不同的钙钛矿，每一层分别放置于不同位置的太阳光谱中，以制造串联太阳能电池。其中，顶部钙钛矿层具有宽带隙，可以很好地吸收光谱中的紫外线部分，以及一些可见光，底层钙钛矿层的带隙很窄，更偏向于光谱的红外部分。这种设计不仅有助于覆盖比硅更多的光谱，而且串联设计使电池能够产生非常高的开路电压，从而提高其效率。不过，他们发现电场在钙钛矿层上的表面电势是不均匀的。为了解决这个问题，研究人员在钙钛矿层表面涂上了一种称为1,3-丙二铵的物质，这种物质带有带正电荷，能够平衡表面电势。而且添加涂层时，钙钛矿层与电子传输层的能量排列更好，使得太阳能电池的功率转换效率高达27.4%，并且在连续运行500小时后，仍然能够保持86%的初始效率。该研究有助于推动电力供应脱碳事业的发展。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-international-collaboration-all-perovskite-tandem-solar.html"}, {"title": "美国研发出搭载激光分光光度计芯片的可穿戴设备", "keyword": "激光分光光度计芯片 分光光度法 微转移印刷", "content_zh": "Photonics初创公司Eyes带激光分光光度计芯片的可穿戴设备公司利用微转移打印(MTP)技术开发了一种新的高密度激光分光光度计芯片。智能手表在可穿戴市场上蓬勃发展的原因之一（与AR/VR眼镜形成鲜明对比）是这些设备提供了持续的健康监测。 为了做到这一点，智能手表通常依赖光学监测技术，如光电体积描记术和分光光度计。可穿戴开发人员正在大力投资于这些光学技术的进步，以改善和扩大健康监测能力。 9月22日，初创公司Rockley Photonics推出了一款新的高密度激光分光光度计芯片，在智能手表行业引起了轩然大波。什么是激光分光光度计？Rockley的新技术依赖于分光光度计，这是健康监测的标准光学方法之一。 分光光度法是一种基于光吸收测量血液中生物标志物的非侵入性技术。 这项技术是由两种工具组合而成的：一种是光谱仪，产生所需波长的光，另一种是光度计，测量光的强度。光谱仪将特定波长的光通过用户的皮肤发送，而光度计位于皮肤的另一侧，测量到达皮肤另一侧的光的强度。 根据体内某些分析物的水平和浓度，只有一定量的光会被吸收。 通过测量接收光的强度，分光光度计可以确定这些分析物的浓度。洛克利发布激光分光光度计芯片本周，光子学初创公司洛克利宣布了一种新的用于磨损的激光分光光度计芯片。此次发布的最重要的方面之一是芯片使用了微转移印刷(MTP)，这是一种以高精度集成极小和异质材料的方法。 根据罗克利的说法，新的芯片家族是世界上第一个MTP分光光度计芯片，随之而来的是巨大的优势。该公司声称，MTP在其用于生物传感的光子学集成电路中实现了前所未有的激光密度。 通过MTP工艺，新芯片将集成一个4微米厚的激光产生膜。 其结果是所谓的世界上最高密度、宽波长激光分光光度计芯片。洛克利列举了这种芯片的几个潜在应用，包括更薄的可穿戴设备、智能服装和AR/VR耳机。洛克利将小型化推向了下一个水平，覆盖1000纳米的光谱，根据洛克利的说法，新的分光光度计芯片是行业中最小的宽带红外波长激光光谱测量芯片。 此外，该公司声称其芯片的面积比其他基于LED的可穿戴设备解决方案小，降低了这些设备的制造成本。利用其MTP技术，Rockley计划进一步减小其分光光度计芯片的尺寸和密度。 使用MTP的基于硅光子学的新生物传感芯片将于2024年前六个月推出。 ", "content_en": "Photonics Startup Eyes Wearables With Laser Spectrophotometer ChipThe company leverages micro-transfer printing (mTP) for a new high-density laser spectrophotometer chip.One of the reasons smartwatches have thrived in the wearable market (in contrast to, say, AR/VR glasses) is that these devices provide continuous health monitoring. To do this, smartwatches generally rely on optical monitoring techniques such as photoplethysmography and spectrophotometry.Wearable developers are investing heavily in such optical technology advances to improve and expand health monitoring capabilities. On Sept. 22, startup Rockley Photonics made a splash in the smartwatch industry by introducing a new high-density laser spectrophotometer chip.What is Laser Spectrophotometry?Rockley’s new technology relies on spectrophotometry, one of the standard optical methods for health monitoring. Spectrophotometry is a non-invasive technique to measure biomarkers in blood based on light absorption. The technique works by combining two tools: a spectrometer, which produces light of a desired wavelength, and a photometer, which measures the intensity of light.The spectrometer sends a specific wavelength of light through the user’s skin while the photometer sits on the other side of the skin and measures the intensity of the light that makes it to the other side. Only a certain amount of light will be absorbed based on the level and concentration of certain analytes in the body. By measuring the intensity of the received light, the spectrophotometer can determine these analyte concentrations.Rockley Releases Laser Spectrophotometer ChipThis week, photonics startup Rockley announced a new laser spectrophotometer chip for wearables.One of the most significant aspects of the release is the chip’s use of micro-transfer printing (mTP), a method that integrates extremely small and heterogeneous materials with a high degree of accuracy. According to Rockley, the new chip family is the world’s first mTP spectrophotometer chip, and with it comes big advantages.The company claims mTP enables unprecedented laser density in its photonics integrated circuits used for biosensing. With the mTP process, the new chip will integrate a 4-micron-thick, laser-generating membrane. The result is the so-called world’s highest-density, broad-wavelength laser spectrophotometer chip.Rockley cites several potential applications for this chip, including thinner wearables, smart clothing, and AR/VR headsets.Rockley Takes Miniaturization to the Next LevelCovering 1,000 nanometers of spectrum, the new spectrophotometer chips are the industry's smallest for broadband infrared wavelength laser spectrometry, according to Rockley. Additionally, the company claims its chips have a smaller area than other LED-based solutions for wearables, reducing manufacturing costs for these devices.Using its mTP technology, Rockley plans to further reduce the size and increase the density of its spectrophotometer chips.

To do this, they have been leveraging the multi-redox reactions of materials that are highly abundant on Earth, such as iron and manganese, which could help to lower battery fabrication costs.A team of researchers at Seoul National University has identified a-LiFeSO4F, an amorphous iron fluorisulfate electrode that could be used to develop more affordable high-capacity batteries. This electrode, presented in a paper in Nature Energy, specifically serves as a cathode (i.e., the positively charged electrode in a battery cell, through which electrons enter electronic devices).The iron fluorisulfate cathode they created was inspired by a nanocomposite material that they had introduced in one of their previous works, where they also elucidated its underpinning redox mechanism and surface conversion reaction. This material is composed of nanosized lithium and a transition metal compound.\"Previously, we were studying the strategies for obtaining additional capacities from our nanocomposite cathode material,\" Kisuk Kang, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. \"As the redox mechanism of the material is similar to a conversion reaction and is typically synthesized by the high energy ball milling, we were able to attain a better understanding of the conversion reaction and mechanochemical synthesis.\"The team's new study is based on the observations and findings collected in their previous research. Specifically, their past findings inspired them to explore the possibility that their nanocomposite cathode material's conversion reaction, combined with an intercalation capability, would allow them to unlock the unique capacity of the transition metal oxides within it.\"During the development of this concept, we pondered on how to effectively enhance the reversibility of an intercalation/conversion dual-type electrode material,\" Kang explained. \"We came to the conclusion that an amorphous structure could help to achieve this, considering the nature of the conversion reaction.\"The cathode realized by Kang and his colleagues is made of LiFeSO4F, but with an amorphous (i.e., not crystalline) structure. This material could be easily synthesized using mechanochemical processes, specifically through the high-energy ball milling of lithium fluoride (LiF) and iron sulfate (FeSO4).A remarkable advantage of the researchers' cathode is that it supports the reversible insertion and extraction of lithium ions through two processes known as intercalation and conversion. This significantly increases its cumulative capacity, which could in turn improve a battery's life and performance.\"Our study unveiled the novel role of amorphous structure in enabling the reversibility of dual-type intercalation/conversion electrode material,\" Kang said. \"The reversible and simultaneous utilization of intercalation and conversion reactions in the amorphous structure is broadly applicable to other transition metal compounds and thus enlarges the candidate group of high-energy density cathode material.\"In the future, the cathode introduced by this team of researchers could be used to create high-capacity and low-cost battery technologies. In addition, its underlying chemical processes might also be replicated using other transition metal compounds, which would open new possibilities for the creation of highly performing cathodes based on Earth-abundant materials.\"Since we verified our concept, we have been exploring a more expansive compositional space to identify other possible cathode materials,\" Kang added. \"Moreover, we are studying the general governing rules related to the synthesis of amorphous structure and the correlations between amorphization and intercalation capability.\"", "abstract": "近日，韩国首尔国立大学制备了一种非晶态的氟硫酸铁电极：a-LiFeSO4F。非晶态的LiFeSO4F被认为是一种高容量的电极材料，可以成功地利用插层反应和转换反应。这种材料可以提供360mAh/g的可逆容量，具有200次循环的出色的循环稳定性，在25℃和60℃下容量保持率分别为90%和98.6%。观察到的可逆反应被归因于a-LiFeSO4F的非晶态特性，因为固有的缺陷的非晶态结构对通常伴随着重复转换/再转换反应的潜在结构紊乱而言是免疫的。此外，原始a-LiFeSO4F相和放电产物的非晶态性质提供了富含空位的环境，在这种环境中，金属（Fe2+）跨越体/界面的迁移比结晶相中的迁移更容易，从而促进了还原/转换电极动力学的发展。包括插层和转换反应在内的高度可逆的多机制锂化过程的成功展示意味着在各种非晶态插层材料中可以更普遍地实现高容量特性。在这个方向上的进一步研究将提供新的机会来解决以低成本获得高容量的难题，使传统的基于插层的电极的容量上限被打破。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-12-amorphous-high-capacity-iron-fluorosulfate-cathode.html"}, {"title": "美国开发出新型半导体二维材料，有望推动低功耗电子设备技术发展", "keyword": "光子控制二极管 石墨烯 二硫化钼", "content_zh": "新型半导体可能推进低能电子宾夕法尼亚州立大学和麻省理工学院(MIT)之间的研究伙伴关系可能使一种改进的方法能够制造一种新型半导体，这种半导体只有几个原子薄，并以不寻常的方式与光相互作用。 这种新的半导体可能会导致新的计算和通信技术，这些技术比当前的电子使用更低的能量。这种新型的半导体，硒化锡(SNSE)，将有助于开发一种被称为“光子学”的新型电子学，这种电子学使用光粒子或光子来存储、操纵和传输信息。 传统电子学是用电子来做到这一点，而光子学是用光子。 硒化锡是一种由锡和硒以1：1的比例组成的二元化合物。这种材料与光有特殊的相互作用，这给了它在电子领域的巨大应用潜力。“它可以被描述为一种有两种不同颜色的材料，这意味着根据你看它的方向，你会观察到不同的颜色，”麻省理工学院材料科学与工程系博士后助理、该研究的主要作者Wouter Mortelmans说。 “这种奇特的光学特性对利用光计算、存储或传输信息非常有用。”莫特尔曼说，为了利用这些依赖于取向的特性，在原子精度控制下制造这种材料是非常重要的。 颜色对材料取向的依赖将使材料质量的检查更快、更容易。“我们需要一种可靠的方法来制造材料，制造符合规格的器件，而不用担心随机的自然变化，”麻省理工学院材料科学与工程托马斯·洛德副教授、发表在ACS Nano上的这项研究的高级作者拉斐尔·贾拉米洛说。实现这种精度、无缺陷材料的关键是一个对原子薄半导体称为外延的过程具有挑战性。“外延可以想象成类似于用乐高建造， 宾夕法尼亚州立大学材料研究所二维晶体联盟(2DCC)薄膜-MBE助理研究教授玛丽亚·希尔斯说：“在那里，感兴趣的材料被分解成三角形或矩形乐高积木的单个小单元。”底座是一个超清洁的主晶体基底，允许在上面放上某种形状的‘乐高’积木。 理想情况下，我们选择这个起始基底板，以便它与我们想要组成的材料的晶体结构完美匹配，即我们的乐高积木。 在SNSE的情况下，我们将有一个矩形的乐高积木池，我们希望组装在矩形的乐高底板上，这是一个氧化铝（11-20）表面。“这项研究部分是由Jaramillo和2DCC之间的研究关系促成的。 2DCC是一个由国家科学基金会支持的国家用户设施，专注于为下一代电子和量子技术推进2D层状硫族化合物的合成。“大约一半的实验工作是在2DCC进行的，由莫特尔曼博士和希尔斯博士亲自合作，”哈拉米洛说。 “与2DCC的合作极大地扩展了我们可以使用的实验能力，使这个项目比其他情况下更加严格和令人信服。 特别是，与希尔斯博士和其他人的早期讨论对于激励和降低这项工作的风险很重要。“希尔斯在2DCC的责任包括生长设施，在那里进行了研究的部分SNSE生长。”2DCC使沃特有可能来到宾夕法尼亚州立大学，在现场接受我的合成方法培训，这使他能够进行他为这份出版物所需的实验，“希尔斯说。 “2DCC的独特能力以及我的监督和经验有助于积累该出版物所依据的数据量。”这种合作伙伴关系研究中概述的结果为研究人员和公众都带来了好处。 Mortelmans说，对研究人员来说，它为2D材料的制造提供了见解。“我们为一种具有原子精度控制的2D材料开发了一种新的外延工艺，这在如何制造高质量的2D材料方面获得了新的见解，”Mortelmans说。 “2D材料外延过程的研究是一个相对年轻的领域，有优化的空间。随着这项工作中获得的新见解，我们希望进一步为2D材料外延过程的进步做出贡献。”此外，研究人员开发了一种原始的结构表征方法来测量外延生长的2D材料的质量。“这种快速简便的结构表征方法适用于所有具有取向依赖光学特性的材料，”贾拉米洛说。 “这种方法可能意味着 ", "content_en": "New type of semiconductor may advance low-energy electronicsA research partnership between Penn State and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) could enable an improved method to make a new type of semiconductor that is a few atoms thin and interacts with light in an unusual way. This new semiconductor could lead to new computing and communications technologies that use lower amounts of energy than current electronics.The new type of semiconductor, tin selenide (SnSe), would be useful for developing a new type of electronics known as \"photonics\" that use particles of light, or photons, to store, manipulate and transmit information. Traditional electronics use electrons to do this, while photonics use photons. Tin selenide is a binary compound consisting of tin and selenium in a 1:1 ratio.The material has a peculiar interaction with light that gives it great potential for use in electronics.\"It can be described as a material that has two different colors, meaning that depending on the orientation that you look at it, you will observe a different color,\" said Wouter Mortelmans, a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, and lead author of the study. \"This peculiar optical property could be very useful to compute, store, or transmit information using light.\"To make use of these orientation-dependent properties, it is very important that the fabrication of the material is done with atomic-precision control, said Mortelmans. The dependence of color on material orientation would enable faster and easier inspection of material quality.\"We need a reliable way to make the material, to manufacture devices to spec, without worrying about random, natural variations,\" said Rafael Jaramillo, Thomas Lord Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT and senior author of the study published in ACS Nano.The key to enabling such precision, defect-free material is a process which can be challenging for atomically thin semiconductors known as epitaxy.\"Epitaxy can be imagined as similar to building with Legos, where the material of interest is broken up into small individual unit cells of either triangular or rectangular Lego bricks,\" said Maria Hilse, assistant research professor, thin films-MBE, with the Penn State Materials Research Institute's 2D Crystal Consortium (2DCC). \"The base is an ultra-clean host crystal substrate that allows for a certain shape of 'Lego' bricks to be put on it. We select this starting substrate plate, ideally, so that it fits perfectly with the crystal structure of the material we want to compose, i.e., our Lego bricks. In the case of SnSe, we would have a pool of rectangular-shaped Lego bricks that we want to assemble on a rectangular-shaped Lego base plate, which is an aluminum oxide (11-20) surface.\"The study was enabled in part by a research relationship between Jaramillo and the 2DCC. The 2DCC is a national user facility supported by the National Science Foundation that is focused on advancing the synthesis of 2D layered chalcogenides for next-generation electronics and quantum technologies.\"Roughly half of the experimental work was performed at the 2DCC, with hands-on collaboration between Drs. Mortelmans and Hilse,\" Jaramillo said. \"Working with the 2DCC greatly expanded the set of experimental capabilities that we could work with, making this project much more rigorous and convincing than it otherwise would have been. In particular, early discussions with Dr. Hilse and others there were important for motivating and de-risking the work.\"Hilse's responsibilities with the 2DCC include the growth facility where part of the SnSe growth for the study was carried out.\"The 2DCC made it possible for Wouter to come to Penn State and get trained by me on the synthesis method here on site, which enabled him to perform the experiments he needed for this publication,\" Hilse said. \"The unique capabilities of the 2DCC and my supervision and experience helped to accumulate the amount of data that the publication is built on.\"The results outlined in the study of this partnership offer benefits for both researchers and the public. For researchers, said Mortelmans, it offers insights into the fabrication of 2D materials.\"We developed a new epitaxy process for a 2D material with atomic precision control, which gains new insight in how to fabricate high-quality 2D material,\" Mortelmans said. \"The study of epitaxy processes of 2D materials is a relatively young field with room for optimizations. With the new insights obtained in this work, we hope to further contribute to the advancement of epitaxy processes of 2D materials.\"In addition, the researchers developed an original structural characterization method to measure the quality of the epitaxially grown 2D material.\"This fast and easy structural characterization method applies to all materials that have orientational-dependent optical properties,\" Jaramillo said. \"This method could significantly reduce the time and cost for the further development of such materials.\"In turn, the kind of widespread photonic technology that their research could help enable would have multiple benefits for society. These range from reduced power consumption for large-scale electronics to low-cost environmental sensors for agriculture, air quality monitoring, public health and transportation, to computer vision and light-based sensing for improved safety systems in self-driving vehicles.\"Photonics has tremendous potential to reduce power consumption particularly at large data centers, which are a big and growing consumer of electrical power, and thereby are responsible for a sizable fraction of greenhouse gases emitted by electrical power generation,\" Jaramillo said. \"Therefore, in a quantifiable way, future light-based computing can slow global warming.\"Given the new fabrication process developed by the researchers is a first step to making information storage and transmission in SnSe using light possible, Mortelmans said it is very possible the MIT researchers will be back using the 2DCC facilities and expertise in the future.\"The 2DCC has outstanding facilities to fabricate 2D materials and measure the ultra-thin films after fabrication,\" Mortelmans said. \"There is a lot of expertise available in many different important areas of 2D materials R&D.

Now, KAUST researchers have developed a novel approach for designing and building such high-performance scintillator materials for detecting X-rays at low doses.A scintillator is a material that, when hit by high-energy ionizing radiation such as X-rays, absorbs the energy and reemits some of it as low energy visible light. Scintillators are widely used for X-ray imaging screens in multiple applications, from airport security scanners to medical radiography. However, most existing scintillators are made from ceramic or perovskite materials, which are often fabricated under harsh conditions and can be plagued with poor stability over time when exposed to light and air.\"Organic-based scintillators have inherent advantages, such as low toxicity, high mechanical flexibility, low cost and straightforward large-scale production,\" says Jian-Xin Wang at KAUST, who worked on the project under the supervision of Omar Mohammed and co-workers. \"However, balancing the X-ray absorption capability, exciton utilization efficiency and photoluminescence quantum yield of organic scintillators has proven challenging.\"To date, organic scintillator materials have been hampered by the small range of X-ray frequencies that they can naturally absorb. However, Wang and co-workers realized that X-ray absorption should increase dramatically as the atomic number of the incorporated elements increases. In particular, the team hypothesized that the addition of heavy atoms to the scintillator material could resolve this issue. X-ray photons can interact efficiently with heavy atoms due to their photoelectric effect—the emission of electrons under excitation from radiation.\"We used a simple molecular engineering strategy to design novel organic scintillators,\" says Wang. \"We began by introducing chlorine, bromine or iodine to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) chromophores. We then observed how these heavy atoms altered the efficiency and resolution of the resulting X-ray images.\"TADF chromophores are useful because they exist in an excited quantum \"triplet state\" in the form of excitons—bound states of electrons and electron holes that are created when a high-energy X-ray photon is absorbed, \"lifting an electron out of its hole.\" The triplet state converts to a singlet state when the chromophores absorb thermal energy. They can then de-excite to the ground state and emit light in a process called delayed fluorescence.\"This means that, due to the minimized singlet-triplet energy gap, TADF chromophores can harness both the singlet and triplet excitons that are generated when they are exposed to X-ray radiation,\" says Wang. \"This dramatically improves the exciton utilization efficiency of the scintillator, which in turn provides much higher X-ray spatial imaging resolution and ultralow detection sensitivity,\" says Mohammed.The technique of fabricating screens using scintillators doped with heavy atoms has proved successful so far. One of the team's scintillators, made using TADF-Br (bromine) chromophores, exceeded the resolution of most reported organic and organometallic scintillation screens.\"These fabricated screens provide a powerful design approach and promising new alternative materials for making X-ray imaging scintillators with outstanding sensitivity, low cost and high stability,\" says Mohammed.Related research is published in the journals Nature Photonics and Matter.The team is currently manufacturing a portable X-ray sensor with their fabricated screen for high-resolution medical imaging, including dental examinations and health checks.

Challenges remain in achieving these technological goals, however, including how to precisely manipulate information in quantum systems.In a paper published in Nature Physics, a group of researchers from the University of Rochester, including John Nichol, an associate professor of physics, outlines a new method for controlling electron spin in silicon quantum dots—tiny, nanoscale semiconductors with remarkable properties—as a way to manipulate information in a quantum system.\"The results of the study provide a promising new mechanism for coherent control of qubits based on electron spin in semiconductor quantum dots, which could pave the way for the development of a practical silicon-based quantum computer,\" Nichol says.Using quantum dots as qubitsA regular computer consists of billions of transistors, called bits. Quantum computers, on the other hand, are based on quantum bits, also known as qubits. Unlike ordinary transistors, which can be either \"0\" (off) or \"1\" (on), qubits are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and can be both \"0\" and \"1\" at the same time.Scientists have long considered using silicon quantum dots as qubits; controlling the spin of electrons in quantum dots would offer a way to manipulate the transfer of quantum information. Every electron in a quantum dot has intrinsic magnetism, like a tiny bar magnet. Scientists call this \"electron spin\"—the magnetic moment associated with each electron—because each electron is a negatively charged particle that behaves as though it were rapidly spinning, and it is this effective motion that gives rise to the magnetism.Electron spin is a promising candidate for transferring, storing, and processing information in quantum computing because it offers long coherence times and high gate fidelities and is compatible with advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques. The coherence time of a qubit is the time before the quantum information is lost due to interactions with a noisy environment; long coherence means a longer time to perform computations. High gate fidelity means that the quantum operation researchers are trying to perform is performed exactly as they want.One major challenge in using silicon quantum dots as qubits, however, is controlling electron spin.Controlling electron spinThe standard method for controlling electron spin is electron spin resonance (ESR), which involves applying oscillating radiofrequency magnetic fields to the qubits. However, this method has several limitations, including the need to generate and precisely control the oscillating magnetic fields in cryogenic environments, where most electron spin qubits are operated. Typically, to generate oscillating magnetic fields, researchers send a current through a wire, and this generates heat, which can disturb cryogenic environments.Nichol and his colleagues outline a new method for controlling electron spin in silicon quantum dots that does not rely on oscillating electromagnetic fields. The method is based on a phenomenon called \"spin-valley coupling,\" which occurs when electrons in silicon quantum dots transition between different spin and valley states. While the spin state of an electron refers to its magnetic properties, the valley state refers to a different property related to the electron's spatial profile.The researchers apply a voltage pulse to harness the spin-valley coupling effect and manipulate the spin and valley states, controlling the electron spin.\"This method of coherent control, by spin-valley coupling, allows for universal control over qubits, and can be performed without the need of oscillating magnetic fields, which is a limitation of ESR,\" Nichol says. \"This allows us a new pathway for using silicon quantum dots to manipulate information in quantum computers.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国罗切斯特大学研究人员开发出一种控制硅量子点电子自旋的新方法，该方法可实现量子系统中信息的操纵。长期以来，科学家一直在考虑使用硅量子点作为量子位，然而使用硅量子点作为量子位来控制电子自旋是具有挑战性，且由于电子自旋控制涉及将振荡射频磁场应用于量子位具有多种局限性，因此，研究人员需要一种不依赖于振荡电磁场控制硅量子点电子自旋的新方法。新方法需要在基于硅量子点电子在不同自旋和谷态之间转变时所发生的“自旋谷耦合”现象下完成。为此，研究人员只能通过电压脉冲的自旋谷耦合效应操纵自旋和谷态，从而控制电子自旋。这种通过自旋谷耦合进行相干控制的方法能够对量子位进行通用控制，且可在不需要振荡磁场的情况下执行，从而达到电子自旋共振(ESR)限制。新研究为开发实用型硅基量子计算机创造了条件，为促进量子技术创新发展，开发可应用于计算机、通信和传感设备领域的量子科学提供了理论基础。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-method-electron-paves-efficient-quantum.html"}, {"title": "美国高通公司在最新骁龙智能手机芯片中嵌入人工智能技术", "keyword": "骁龙（Snapdragon）处理器 人工智能技术 芯片", "content_zh": "高通聚焦在其最新的骁龙智能手机中嵌入人工智能ChipQualcomm周二为下一批顶级安卓智能手机推出了最新的骁龙处理器--整个芯片都注入了人工智能，以提高摄影、声音、连接、游戏和安全性。在夏威夷举行的骁龙峰会上，高通将人工智能作为其新骁龙8代2营销宣传的核心，努力将骁龙的名字打造为全球公认的品牌。人工智能通常指的是能够在一定程度上模拟人类智能的计算机系统。 它是当今最热门的技术领域之一。高通长期以来一直致力于人工智能和机器学习，但大多是在幕后。 这家圣地亚哥半导体公司推出了新的骁龙8代2，展示了人工智能，以使其顶级移动处理器脱颖而出。该公司表示，其新的骁龙AI性能比以前的芯片快四倍多。 这使得智能手机能够成为一个传感中心，用于更好地理解语音命令和在飞行中提供多语言翻译等功能。对相机来说，这意味着识别一帧中的多个项目，这样它就可以自动应用滤镜。 例如，当某人戴着眼镜时，芯片上的系统可以自行消除镜头中的眩光。为了安全，“始终感知”摄像头可以识别未知的人何时从主人的肩膀上看，并从屏幕上屏蔽潜在的敏感信息。对于声音，处理器支持空间音频头部跟踪，因此音乐跟随头部运动。 在游戏方面，它支持光线追踪，以获得更高质量的阴影和反射。在连接方面，骁龙使用人工智能来提高无线互联网连接的强度。 它还支持最新的Wi-Fi 7技术，速度超过每秒5千兆。骁龙8 Gen 2预计将为至少14家制造商的设备提供动力，这些制造商将于今年年底推出，包括摩托罗拉、一加、索尼、夏普和华硕，以及中国品牌小米、OPPO和vivo。“我们致力于让人们做更多事情，所以我们以用户为中心设计骁龙，”移动手机高级副总裁兼总经理克里斯·帕特里克说 ", "content_en": "Qualcomm spotlights embedded artificial intelligence in its latest Snapdragon smartphone chipQualcomm launched its latest Snapdragon processor on Tuesday for the next crop of top-tier Android smartphones—with artificial intelligence infused throughout the chip to boost photography, sound, connectivity, gaming and security.At its Snapdragon Summit event in Hawaii, Qualcomm made artificial intelligence the centerpiece of its marketing pitch for its new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 as it strives to build the Snapdragon name into a globally recognized brand.Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that can simulate human intelligence to a certain extent.

Microelectronics has changed the way we manipulate electricity, enabling sophisticated electronic products that are now an essential part of our daily lives. Similarly, integrated photonics has been revolutionizing the way we control light for applications such as data communications, imaging, sensing, and biomedical devices. By routing and shaping light using micro- and nanoscale components, integrated photonics shrinks full optical systems into the size of tiny chips.Despite its success, integrated photonics has been missing a key component to achieve complete miniaturization: high-performance chip-scale lasers. While some progress has been done on near-infrared lasers, the visible-light lasers that currently feed photonic chips are still benchtop and expensive. Since visible light is essential for a wide range of applications including quantum optics, displays, and bioimaging, there is a need for tunable and narrow-linewidth chip-scale lasers emitting light of different colors.Inventing high-performance lasers that fit on a fingertipResearchers at Columbia Engineering's Lipson Nanophotonics Group have created visible lasers of very pure colors from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared that fit on a fingertip. The colors of the lasers can be precisely tuned and extremely fast—up to 267 petahertz per second, which is critical for applications such as quantum optics. The team is the first to demonstrate chip-scale narrow-linewidth and tunable lasers for colors of light below red—green, cyan, blue, and violet. These inexpensive lasers also have the smallest footprint and shortest wavelength (404 nm) of any tunable and narrow-linewidth integrated laser emitting visible light. The study, which was first presented at the CLEO 2021 post-deadline session on May 14, 2021, was published online December 23, 2022, by Nature Photonics.\"What's exciting about this work is that we've used the power of integrated photonics to break the existing paradigm that high-performance visible lasers need to be benchtop and cost tens of thousands of dollars,\" says the study's lead author Mateus Corato Zanarella, a Ph.D. student who works with Michal Lipson, Higgins Professor of Electrical Engineering and professor of applied physics. \"Until now, it's been impossible to shrink and mass-deploy technologies that require tunable and narrow-linewidth visible lasers. A notable example is quantum optics, which demands high-performance lasers of several colors in a single system. We expect that our findings will enable fully integrated visible light systems for existing and new technologies.\"Benefits of emitting wavelengths below redThe importance of lasers emitting wavelengths shorter than red is clear when you consider some important applications. Displays, for example, require red, green, and blue light simultaneously to compose any color. In quantum optics, green, blue, and violet lasers are used for trapping and cooling atoms and ions. In underwater Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), green or blue light is needed to avoid water absorption. However, at wavelengths shorter than red, the coupling and propagation losses of photonic integrated circuits increase significantly, which has prevented the realization of high-performance lasers at these colors.Solving coupling and propagation loss issuesThe researchers solved the coupling loss problem by choosing Fabry-Perot (FP) diodes as the light sources, which minimizes the impact of the losses on the performance of the chip-scale lasers. Unlike other strategies that use different types of sources, the team's approach enables the realization of lasers at record-short wavelengths (404 nm) while also providing scalability to high optical powers, FP laser diodes are inexpensive and compact solid-state lasers widely used in research and industry. However, they emit light of several wavelengths simultaneously and are not easily tunable, preventing them to be directly used for applications requiring pure and precise lasers. By combining them with the specially designed photonic chip, the researchers are able to modify the laser emission to be single-frequency, narrow-linewidth, and widely tunable.The team overcame the propagation loss issue by designing a platform that minimizes both the material absorption and surface scattering losses simultaneously for all the visible wavelengths. To guide the light, they used silicon nitride, a dielectric widely used in the semiconductor industry that is transparent for visible light of all colors. Even though there is minimal absorption, the light still experiences loss due to unavoidable roughness from the fabrication processes. The team solved this problem by designing a photonic circuit with a special type of ring resonator. The ring has a variable width along its circumference, allowing for single-mode operation characteristic of narrow waveguides, and low loss characteristic of wide waveguides. The resulting photonic circuit provides a wavelength-selective optical feedback to the FP diodes that forces the laser to emit at a single desired wavelength with very narrow linewidth.\"By combining these intricately designed pieces, we were able to build a robust and versatile platform that is scalable and works for all colors of light,\" said Corato Zanarella.Revolutionizing technologies\"As a laser manufacturer we recognize that integrated photonics will have a tremendous impact on our industry and will enable a new generation of applications that have so far been impossible,\" said Chris Haimberger, Director of Laser Technology, TOPTICA Photonics, Inc. \"This work represents an important step forward in the pursuit of compact and tunable visible lasers that will power future developments in computing, medicine, and industry.\"The study's findings could revolutionize a broad range of applications, including:Quantum information. Most quantum bits for quantum computation use atoms or ions that are trapped and probed using visible light. The light must be very pure (narrow linewidth) and have very specific wavelengths to address atomic transitions. Currently, the lasers available for these applications are expensive and benchtop. This new study shows that these bulky sources can be replaced by tiny and inexpensive chips, which will enable quantum systems to be scaled down and eventually become part of technologies accessible by the general public.Atomic Clocks. The most precise clocks are based on strontium atoms, which need to be trapped and probed by lasers of many different colors at the same time. Similarly to quantum optics systems, the massive size of the currently available lasers confines this technology to research labs. The chip-scale lasers will make it possible to shrink these systems with the goal of making portable atomic clocks.Biosensing.Several neural probes use a technology called optogenetics to measure, modify, and understand the neural response. In this technology, neurons are genetically modified to produce a type of protein called opsin that is sensitive to visible light. By shining visible light, typically blue, into these cells, scientists can turn on specific neurons at will. Similarly, in fluorescent imagining, fluorophores need to be excited with visible light in order to generate the desired images. These high-performance, compact lasers open the doors for miniaturizing these systems.Underwater ranging.Underwater ranging requires blue or green light because ocean water strongly absorbs light of all the other colors. In addition, for the popular ranging strategy called Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave LiDAR, the laser needs to be speedily tunable for accurate sensing of the distance and velocity of objects. These lasers could be used for portable underwater ranging systems employing this technology.Li-Fi. As the demand for bandwidth in communication systems increases, networks have become saturated. Li-Fi, or visible light communications, is a rapidly growing technology that promises to supplement the traditional microwave links at the user end to overcome this bottleneck. The high modulation speeds of the lasers are ideal for enabling extremely fast optical wireless communication links.Next stepsThe researchers, who have filed a provisional patent for their technology, are now exploring how to optically and electrically package the lasers to turn them into standalone units and use them as sources in chip-scale visible light engines, quantum experiments, and optical clocks.\"In order to move forward, we have to be able to miniaturize and scale these systems, enabling them to eventually be incorporated in mass-deployed technologies,\" said Lipson, a pioneer in silicon photonics whose research has strongly shaped the field from its inception decades ago, with foundational contributions in the active and passive devices that are part of any current photonic chip. She added, \"Integrated photonics is an exciting field that is truly revolutionizing our world, from optical telecommunications to quantum information to biosensing.\"The study is titled \"Widely tunable and narrow-linewidth chip-scale lasers from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国哥伦比亚大学工程学院的研究团队开发出了首个可调谐的窄线宽芯片级激光器，该激光器适用于比红色更短的可见光波长，还可以安装在指尖上。其颜色也可以精确调整，速度极快，最高可达每秒267千兆字节，对于量子光学等应用来说有着至关重要的作用。该小组的研究人员通过选择法布里-珀罗(Fabry-Perot,FP)激光二极管作为光源来解决了耦合损耗问题，以最大限度降低损耗对芯片级激光器性能的影响，由此实现创纪录的短波长(404nm)激光，同时还提供高光功率的可扩展性。然而，该二极管在发出多种波长的光时不容易调谐，所以，研究人员只能通过将其与专门设计的光子芯片相结合，实现将激光发射修改为单频、窄线宽和广泛可调谐的可能。该团队还设计了一个平台来克服传播损耗问题。该研究代表在追求紧凑和可调谐可见激光器方面向前迈出的重要一步，在未来为计算、医学和工业的发展提供动力。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-high-performance-visible-light-lasers-fingertip.html"}, {"title": "日本实现对单个铂纳米粒子的精确电荷状态识别", "keyword": "铂纳米粒子 电子全息术技术 全息显微镜", "content_zh": "科学家们将单个催化剂纳米颗粒中的电荷计数到电子如果你经常发现自己在洗完衣服后数袜子时少了一个， 你可能想坐下来看看。日本科学家现在已经将额外或缺失电荷的数量计算到单个铂纳米颗粒中的一个电子的精确度，这些纳米颗粒的直径只有普通病毒的十分之一。这一精确研究金属纳米颗粒净电荷差异的新方法将有助于进一步理解和开发催化剂，将温室和其他有害气体分解为燃料和良性气体，或者有效生产农业肥料所需的氨。由九州大学和日立有限公司领导， 研究小组通过硬件和软件的改进实现了这一极限计数的壮举，将一种称为电子全息的技术的灵敏度提高了十倍。透射电子显微镜使用一束电子来观察原子级的材料，而电子全息术利用电子的类波特性来探测电场和磁场。电子与场的相互作用导致其波的相移，可以通过将其与未受影响的电子的参考波进行比较来识别。 ", "content_en": "Scientists count electric charges in a single catalyst nanoparticle down to the electronIf you often find yourself off by one when counting your socks after doing the laundry, you might want to sit down for this.Scientists in Japan have now counted the number of extra—or missing—charges down to a precision of just one electron in single platinum nanoparticles having diameters only one-tenth those of common viruses.This new process for precisely studying differences in net charge on metal nanoparticles will aid in the further understanding and development of catalysts for breaking down greenhouse and other harmful gases into fuels and benign gases or for efficiently producing ammonia needed for fertilizers used in agriculture.Led by Kyushu University and Hitachi Ltd., the research team achieved this feat of extreme counting through hardware and software improvements that increased tenfold the sensitivity of a technique called electron holography.While transmission electron microscopy uses a beam of electrons to observe materials down to the atomic level, electron holography utilizes the wave-like properties of electrons to probe electric and magnetic fields.Interaction of an electron with fields causes a phase shift in its wave that can be identified by comparing it with a reference wave of an unaffected electron.", "abstract": "表征负载型金属催化剂的一个目标是实现对与催化活性密切相关的电荷状态的逐个粒子分析。近日，日本九州大学和日立公司的研究小组通过改进软硬件将电子全息术灵敏度提高了十倍，并使用全新超高灵敏度和精密度电子全息术直接识别了负载在二氧化钛上的单个铂纳米粒子 (NP) 电荷状态。在这项研究过程中，研究人员将显微镜聚焦在氧化钛表面的单个铂纳米颗粒上，其中铂纳米粒子的直径只有10纳米。为了更好的在铂纳米粒子周围的磁场中实现精准观察，研究人员使用了最先进的1.2-MV原子分辨率全息显微镜，该显微镜可降低机械和电气噪声，在处理数据的同时可以从噪音中梳理出信号。除了识别单个纳米颗粒的电荷状态外，研究人员还能将电荷数量的差异与纳米颗粒晶体结构的差异联系起来。这种精确研究金属纳米粒子净电荷差异的新工艺将有助于进一步理解和开发催化剂，以便将温室气体和其他有害气体分解为燃料和良性气体。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-10-scientists-electric-catalyst-nanoparticle-electron.html"}, {"title": "高通和沃达丰合作开发下一代5G开放无线接入网络", "keyword": "开放无线接入网络 高通 沃达丰 5G RAN加速卡", "content_zh": "高通和沃达丰下一代5G O-RAN团队两家公司将继续合作，努力在整个欧洲扩展5G开放无线接入网(RAN)。高通和沃达丰最近宣布，他们将合作测试和开发基于高通开放RAN（O-RAN）设备的基础设施解决方案，这些设备据称是节能和高性能的:QRU100 5G RAN平台和X100 5G RAN加速器卡。 高通在2022年第三季度开始对这两种卡进行抽样。沃达丰是欧洲领先的电信提供商，公开承诺改善其网络的环境可持续性，并为合作伙伴关系带来大规模网络部署方面的专业知识。 该公司设想未来的网络将支持无线高带宽应用，如虚拟和增强现实。 这两家公司计划在巴塞罗那举行的2023年世界移动大会上公布其5G O-RAN基础设施解决方案的更多细节。 高通X100 5G RAN加速卡是一种“内联加速器”PCIE卡，可以插入商用现货(COTS)网络服务器，以卸载5G网络处理所需的功能。它是一种交钥匙解决方案，将处理信道编码、解调和波束形成的物理层处理。 此外，它还提供了支持大规模多输入多输出(MIMO)部署的计算能力。 在一篇关于CEVA的O-RAN IP产品的文章中，所有关于电路的文章概述了Massive MIMO。高通公司声称，加速卡将此处理所需的功耗和CPU降低了50%，降低了O-RAN的总体拥有成本。规格和特征：包括波束形成、解调、信道编码在内的功能的集成处理， 和Massive MIMOL支持所有7.x开放RAN分裂功能SL X16 Lane Gen 4 PCIE接口在全高半长(FHHL)封装GNSS RF或10 MHz/PP1s时钟接口输入L无源热冷却L 8 GB 3.2 GHz LPDDRL 35 W满载高通QRU100 5G RAN平台Qualcomm QRU100 5G RAN平台旨在为5G网络提供支持，如宽带收发器、前端天线模块（用于MMWave)、RTR4远程无线电头功能，以及对4T4R、8T8R、32T32R的Massive MIMO支持， 和64T64R配置。规格和特征：L开放RAN兼容所有7.x分裂功能SL部署灵活性MMWave到Sub-6 Ghzl多运营商RAN共享，每个端口最多8个CCL动态频谱共享(DSS)L波峰因子降低(CFR)/数字预失真(DPD)L DL 1024 WAM和UL 256 QAM调制L FR1:400 MHz和FR2:10 000 MHz带宽集成300 Gbps以太网开放RAN ObjectiveVodaFone声称是O-RAN的先驱，其愿景是在未来，多个网络供应商和设备供应商可以无缝地为5G网络做出贡献。 传统上，一家网络提供商与一家主要设备供应商合作部署他们的基础设施。为了降低供应商的进入壁垒，沃达丰和高通在2021年第二季度合作开发O-RAN技术的技术蓝图和参考设计。 这将有助于增加多样性、竞争和创新，并提高对供应链中断的鲁棒性。 沃达丰还启动了一个O-RAN测试和验证实验室来支持这一努力。 ", "content_en": "Qualcomm and Vodafone Team for Next-gen 5G O-RAN EffortThe two companies will continue to collaborate on efforts to expand 5G Open Radio Access Network (RAN) across Europe.Qualcomm and Vodafone recently announced that they will collaborate to test and develop infrastructure solutions that will be based on Qualcomm’s Open RAN (O-RAN) devices that are claimed to be energy efficient and high performing: the QRU100 5G RAN Platform, and the X100 5G RAN Accelerator Card.

The channels were wide but shallow, a geometry that reduced the likelihood that photons would scatter out of the waveguides. Encapsulating the waveguides in silicon dioxide also helped to reduce scattering.The scientists reported that their prototype circuits have a loss of intensity equal to only one percent of similar circuits—also using quantum dots—that were fabricated by other teams.Ultimately, devices that incorporate this new chip technology could take advantage of the strange properties of quantum mechanics to perform complex computations that classical (non-quantum) circuits may not be capable of doing.For instance, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, a single photon has a probability of residing in two different places, such as two different waveguides, at the same time. Those probabilities can be used to store information; an individual photon can act as a quantum bit, or qubit, which carries much more information than the binary bit of a classical computer, which is limited to a value of 0 or 1.To perform operations necessary to solve computational problems, these photon qubits—all of which travel at the same speed and are indistinguishable from each other—must simultaneously arrive at specific processing nodes in the circuit. That poses a challenge because photons originating from different locations—and traveling along different waveguides—across the circuit may lie at significantly different distances from processing points. To ensure simultaneous arrival, photons emitted closer to the designated destination must delay their journey, giving those that lie in more distant waveguides a head start.The circuit devised by NIST researchers including Ashish Chanana and Marcelo Davanco, along with an international team of colleagues, allows for significant time delays because it employs waveguides of various lengths that can store photons for relatively long periods of time. For instance, the researchers calculate that a 3-meter-long waveguide (tightly coiled so its diameter on a chip is only a few millimeters) would have a 50 percent probability of transmitting a photon with a time delay of 20 nanoseconds (billionths of a second). By comparison, previous devices, developed by other teams and operating under similar conditions, were limited to inducing time delays only one one-hundredth as long.The longer delay times achieved with the new circuit are also important for operations in which photons from one or more quantum dots need to arrive at a specific location at equally spaced time intervals. In addition, the low-loss quantum-dot circuit could dramatically increase the number of single photons available for carrying quantum information on a chip, enabling larger, speedier, and more reliable computational and information-processing systemsThe scientists, who include researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Korea Institute of Science and Technology and the University of S?o Paulo in Brazil, reported their findings December 11 in Nature Communications.The hybrid circuit consists of two components, each initially built on a separate chip. One, a gallium arsenide semiconductor device designed and fabricated at NIST, hosts the quantum dots and directly funnels the single photons they generate into a second device—a low-loss silicon nitride waveguide developed at UCSB.To marry the two components, researchers at MIT first used the fine metal tip of a pick-and-place microprobe, acting like a miniature crowbar, to pry the gallium arsenide device from the chip built at NIST. They then placed it atop the silicon nitride circuit on the other chip.The researchers face several challenges before the hybrid circuit can be routinely employed in a photonic device. At present, only about 6 percent of the individual photons generated by the quantum dots can be funneled into the circuit. However, simulations suggest that if the team changes the angle at which the photons are funneled, in tandem with improvements in the positioning and orientation of the quantum dots, the rate could rise above 80 percent.Another issue is that the quantum dots do not always emit single photons at exactly the same wavelength, a requirement for creating the indistinguishable photons necessary for the quantum computational operations. The team is exploring several strategies, including applying a constant electric field to the dots, that may alleviate that problem.", "abstract": "近日，美国国家标准与技术研究所(NIST)通过在单个微芯片上将量子点与微型电路连接起来，开发出可以应用于量子计算的光芯片电路。研究人员将氮化硅波导埋在二氧化硅中，大幅降低了光子从波导中散射出去的概率，有助于减少散射，实现超低损耗电路。此外，研究人员将砷化镓量子点发光芯片和低损耗氮化硅波导器件组成混合电路，通过设计量子点的定位和方向，有望将光子进入电路的比例提升至80%以上，大幅提升光子利用率。该研究成果将促进量子技术的发展，提升量子计算机存储和携带信息的能力，为研发更大、更快、更可靠的计算和信息处理系统奠定基础。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-chip-circuit-quantum.html"}, {"title": "德国研发出一种由聚合物陶瓷材料制成的固体电解质", "keyword": "聚合物 陶瓷纳米纤维 固体电解质 储能容量", "content_zh": "在通往高性能固态电池的道路上：研究人员开发超薄固体电解质操作可靠性、耐久性和高能量密度：在这些方面，固态电池在原理上优于传统的液体电解质锂离子电池。 例如，在电迁移率领域，阻碍广泛工业应用的一些问题是阴极和电解质之间的界面兼容性差以及室温下离子电导率低。拜罗伊特大学Seema Agarwal教授领导的一个国际小组现在开发了一种解决方案：由聚合物-陶瓷复合物组成的非常薄的固体电解质。 研究人员在《先进能源材料》杂志上发表了他们的发现。研究人员开发的固体电解质是聚合物和陶瓷纳米纤维的结合体。 这种复合材料被应用--非常像涂层--到阴极的多孔表面。 在这里，它填充了微小的腔体，形成了一种与阴极稳定接触的固体电解质，厚度只有大约7微米。与早期的固态电池相比，这种新系统的特点是电解质像外壳一样包围了阴极颗粒。 这创造了一个显著改善的界面，它具有激活阴极中的离子的额外优势。 由于这种改进，新的固体电解质增加了电池的储能能力，这种超薄固体电解质与阴极相互作用的另一个主要优点是大大提高了电池的运行可靠性。 “重复使用液体电解质的常规锂离子电池会造成安全问题。电解液总是有泄漏的风险，导致电池短路失效。手机、笔记本电脑和电动汽车已经因此起火，造成严重事故。”一个额外的问题是阳极上锂的生长，即所谓的界面枝晶，它们刺穿电解液，可以导致短路或火灾。 拜罗伊特大学高分子化学教授Seema Agarwal博士解释说：“所有这些风险都被我们的超薄复合固体电解质消除或至少显著降低，它具有高热稳定性。”新研究的主要作者Sivaraj Pazhaniswamy博士指出了另一个优势：“如果使用热稳定的固体电解质而不是易燃的液体电解质，就有可能充分利用锂作为阳极材料。 与传统液体电解质电池中使用的其他材料相比，锂具有非常吸引人的性能，如高理论容量和低电化学电位。“现在我们的新固体电解质在与阴极的相互作用中表现如此出色，我们想用类似的系统优化电解质和阳极之间的接触。” ", "content_en": "On the way to high-performance solid-state batteries: Researchers develop ultra-thin solid electrolyteOperational reliability, durability and high energy density: In these respects, solid-state batteries are superior in principle to conventional liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries. Some of the problems standing in the way of widespread industrial application—in the field of electromobility, for example—are the poor interface compatibility between cathode and electrolyte and low ionic conductivity at room temperature.An international team led by Prof. Dr. Seema Agarwal at the University of Bayreuth has now developed a solution: a very thin solid electrolyte consisting of a polymer-ceramic composite. The researchers present their discovery in the journal Advanced Energy Materials.The solid electrolyte that the researchers developed is a combination of a polymer and ceramic nanofibers. This composite material is applied—very much like a coating—to the porous surface of the cathode. Here, it fills the tiny cavities, forming a solid electrolyte that has stable contact with the cathode and is only about seven micrometers thin.Compared with earlier solid-state batteries, this new system is characterized by the fact that the electrolyte encloses the cathode particles like a shell. This creates a significantly improved interface, which has the added advantage of activating the ions in the cathode. Due to this modification, the new solid electrolyte increases the energy storage capacity of the batteries.Another major advantage of this ultrathin solid electrolyte interacting with the cathode is that it greatly increases the operational reliability of the batteries. \"Conventional lithium-ion batteries that use liquid electrolytes repeatedly cause safety problems. There is always a risk that the electrolyte will leak, causing the battery to short circuit and fail. Cell phones, laptops and electric vehicles have already caught fire because of this, causing serious accidents.\"An additional problem is the growing of lithium on the anode, the so-called interface dendrites, which pierce the electrolyte and can lead to a short circuit or fire. All these risks are eliminated or at least significantly reduced by our ultra-thin composite solid electrolyte, which has high thermal stability,\" explains Prof. Dr. Seema Agarwal, Professor of Macromolecular Chemistry at the University of Bayreuth.The lead author of the new study, Dr. Sivaraj Pazhaniswamy, points to another advantage: \"If a thermally stable solid electrolyte is used instead of a flammable liquid electrolyte, it is possible to take full advantage of lithium as an anode material. Compared to other materials used in conventional liquid electrolyte batteries, lithium has highly attractive properties, such as high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential.\"Now that our new solid electrolyte has performed so excellently in its interactions with the cathode, we want to work toward optimizing the contacts between electrolyte and anode with a similar system.\"", "abstract": "近日，由德国拜罗伊特大学领导的一个研究团队研发出一种由聚合物陶瓷复合材料制造而成的超薄固体电解质。在这项新研究中，该团队开发的固体电解质是聚合物和陶瓷纳米纤维的组合。这种复合材料被涂覆到阴极的多孔表面，非常像涂层。在这里，它填充了微小的空腔，形成了与阴极稳定接触的固体电解质，厚度只有约7微米。与早期的固态电池相比，新的固体电解质增加了电池的储能容量。此外，这种超薄固体电解质与阴极相互作用的另一个主要优点是，它大大增加了电池的运行可靠性。该团队表示，新固体电解质的开发向高性能固态电池迈出了重要一步，有望在下一阶段通过类似的系统来优化电解质和阳极之间的接触。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-01-high-performance-solid-state-batteries-ultra-thin-solid.html"}, {"title": "美国通过电子桥来实现半导体之间的能量快速共享", "keyword": "半导体材料 二硒化钨 二硫化钨 电子桥 能量快速共享", "content_zh": "随着半导体器件变得越来越小，研究人员正在探索二维材料在晶体管和光电子学中的潜在应用。 控制电和热在这些材料中的流动是它们功能的关键，但首先我们需要在原子尺度上理解这些行为的细节。现在，研究人员发现电子在二维半导体材料二硒化钨(WSE2)和二硫化钨(WS2)层之间能量转移的过程中扮演了令人惊讶的角色。 研究人员发现，尽管这些层之间没有紧密结合，但电子在它们之间提供了一个桥梁，有助于快速传热。“我们的工作表明，我们需要超越乐高积木的类比，来理解不同的二维材料的堆叠，即使这些层之间没有强烈结合，”能源部劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室（伯克利实验室）的科学家阿查纳·拉贾说，他领导了这项研究。 “看似不同的层，实际上通过共享的电子路径进行通信，使我们能够访问并最终设计出大于各部分之和的属性。”这项研究最近发表在《自然·纳米技术》杂志上，结合了超快原子尺度温度测量和广泛理论计算的见解。该研究的共同第一作者、现任斯坦福大学研究科学家阿迪蒂亚·苏德（Aditya Sood）表示：“这项实验的动机是关于纳米级结中原子运动的基本问题，但这些发现对未来电子器件的能量耗散有影响。” “我们很好奇当热流在两种材料之间时，电子和原子振动是如何相互耦合的。通过以原子精度放大界面，我们发现了这种耦合的惊人高效机制。”一种具有原子精度的超快温度计研究人员研究了由WSE2和WS2堆叠单层组成的器件。 这些器件是由伯克利实验室分子铸造厂的拉贾小组制造的，他们完善了使用透明胶带剥离半导体晶体单层的艺术，每个单层厚度不到一纳米。 使用在自制堆叠显微镜下排列的聚合物邮票，这些层被沉积在彼此之上，并精确地放置在微观窗口上，以使电子能够通过样本传输。在能源部SLAC国家加速器实验室进行的实验中，该团队使用了一种被称为超快电子衍射(UED)的技术来测量各个层的温度，同时光激励WSE2层中的电子。 UED充当了一个“电子照相机”，捕捉每一层原子的位置。 通过将激发脉冲和探测脉冲之间的时间间隔改变万亿分之一秒，他们可以独立跟踪每一层的温度变化，使用理论模拟将观察到的原子运动转化为温度。斯坦福大学这项研究的合著者亚伦·林登伯格说：“这种UED方法提供了一种直接测量这种复杂异质结构内温度的新方法。” “这些层之间只有几埃的距离，但我们可以有选择地探测它们的反应，作为时间分辨率的结果，我们可以在基本的时间尺度上以一种新的方式探测这些结构之间能量是如何共享的。”他们发现WSE2层不出所料地升温了，但令他们惊讶的是，WS2层也同时升温，这表明层与层之间的热量转移很快。 相比之下，当他们不激发WSE2中的电子，而是使用金属接触层加热异质结构时，WSE2和WS2之间的界面传递的热量非常差，这证实了以前的报道。拉贾说：“非常惊讶地看到两层在光激发后几乎同时升温，这促使我们更深入地理解发生了什么。”电子“胶态”为理解他们的观察创造了桥梁，该团队使用理论计算， 在美国能源部资助的Berkeley实验室计算材料科学中心能源材料激发态现象计算研究中心(C2SEPEM)的支持下，研究人员利用基于密度泛函理论的方法来模拟原子和电子在这些系统中的行为。研究人员对层状二维WSE2/WS2的电子结构以及层内晶格振动的行为进行了广泛的计算。 就像松鼠穿过森林树冠，它们可以沿着树枝定义的路径奔跑，偶尔在树枝之间跳跃，物质中的电子被限制在特定的状态和跃迁（称为散射），以及对电子的认识 ", "content_en": "Electronic bridge allows rapid energy sharing between semiconductorsAs semiconductor devices become ever smaller, researchers are exploring two-dimensional (2D) materials for potential applications in transistors and optoelectronics. Controlling the flow of electricity and heat through these materials is key to their functionality, but first we need to understand the details of those behaviors at atomic scales.Now, researchers have discovered that electrons play a surprising role in how energy is transferred between layers of 2D semiconductor materials tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2). Although the layers aren't tightly bonded to one another, electrons provide a bridge between them that facilitates rapid heat transfer, the researchers found.\"Our work shows that we need to go beyond the analogy of Lego blocks to understand stacks of disparate 2D materials, even though the layers aren't strongly bonded to one another,\" said Archana Raja, a scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), who led the study. \"The seemingly distinct layers, in fact, communicate through shared electronic pathways, allowing us to access and eventually design properties that are greater than the sum of the parts.\"The study appeared recently in Nature Nanotechnology and combines insights from ultrafast, atomic-scale temperature measurements and extensive theoretical calculations.\"This experiment was motivated by fundamental questions about atomic motions in nanoscale junctions, but the findings have implications for energy dissipation in futuristic electronic devices,\" said Aditya Sood, co-first author of the study and currently a research scientist at Stanford University. \"We were curious about how electrons and atomic vibrations couple to one another when heat flows between two materials. By zooming into the interface with atomic precision, we uncovered a surprisingly efficient mechanism for this coupling.\"An ultrafast thermometer with atomic precisionThe researchers studied devices consisting of stacked monolayers of WSe2 and WS2. The devices were fabricated by Raja's group at Berkeley Lab's Molecular Foundry, who perfected the art of using Scotch tape to lift off crystalline monolayers of the semiconductors, each less than a nanometer in thickness. Using polymer stamps aligned under a home-built stacking microscope, these layers were deposited on top of each other and precisely placed over a microscopic window to enable the transmission of electrons through the sample.In experiments conducted at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the team used a technique known as ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) to measure the temperatures of the individual layers while optically exciting electrons in just the WSe2layer. The UED served as an \"electron camera,\" capturing the atom positions within each layer. By varying the time interval between the excitation and probing pulses by trillionths of a second, they could track the changing temperature of each layer independently, using theoretical simulations to convert the observed atomic movements into temperatures.\"What this UED approach enables is a new way of directly measuring temperature within this complex heterostructure,\" said Aaron Lindenberg, a co-author on the study at Stanford University. \"These layers are only a few angstroms apart, and yet we can selectively probe their response and, as a result of the time resolution, can probe at fundamental time scales how energy is shared between these structures in a new way.\"They found that the WSe2 layer heated up, as expected, but to their surprise, the WS2 layer also heated up in tandem, suggesting a rapid transfer of heat between layers. By contrast, when they didn't excite electrons in the WSe2 and heated the heterostructure using a metal contact layer instead, the interface between WSe2 and WS2 transmitted heat very poorly, confirming previous reports.\"It was very surprising to see the two layers heat up almost simultaneously after photoexcitation and it motivated us to zero in on a deeper understanding of what was going on,\" said Raja.An electronic 'glue state' creates a bridgeTo understand their observations, the team employed theoretical calculations, using methods based on density functional theory to model how atoms and electrons behave in these systems with support from the Center for Computational Study of Excited-State Phenomena in Energy Materials (C2SEPEM), a DOE-funded Computational Materials Science Center at Berkeley Lab.The researchers conducted extensive calculations of the electronic structure of layered 2D WSe2/WS2, as well as the behavior of lattice vibrations within the layers. Like squirrels traversing a forest canopy, who can run along paths defined by branches and occasionally jump between them, electrons in a material are limited to specific states and transitions (known as scattering), and knowledge of that electronic structure provides a guide to interpreting the experimental results.\"Using computer simulations, we explored where the electron in one layer initially wanted to scatter to, due to lattice vibrations,\" said Jonah Haber, co-first author on the study and now a postdoctoral researcher in the Materials Sciences Division at Berkeley Lab. \"We found that it wanted to scatter to this hybrid state—a kind of 'glue state' where the electron is hanging out in both layers at the same time. We have a good idea of what these glue states look like now and what their signatures are and that lets us say relatively confidently that other, 2D semiconductor heterostructures will behave the same way.\"Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that, in the absence of the shared electron \"glue state,\" heat took far longer to move from one layer to another. These simulations were conducted primarily at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).\"The electrons here are doing something important: they are serving as bridges to heat dissipation,\" said Felipe de Jornada, a co-author from Stanford University. \"If we can understand and control that, it offers a unique approach to thermal management in semiconductor devices.\"", "abstract": "近日，美国能源部劳伦斯伯克利分校的研究人员发现电子在二维半导体材料二硒化钨 (WSe2) 和二硫化钨 (WS2)层之间进行能量传输时发挥着重要作用，能让材料层在没有紧密结合的情况下通过电子桥来促进热传递，由此实现半导体之间的能量共享。研究人员主要采用了透明胶带剥离半导体晶体单层技术来让每个半导体厚度都小于1纳米，且采用由堆叠单层二硒化钨和二硫化钨组成的设备。为了让电子能通过样品传输，研究人员用在自制堆叠显微镜下排列的聚合物印模来让材料层之间彼此堆合。该团队还使用一种称为超快电子衍射 (UED) 的技术来测量各个层的温度。结果表明，材料层之间可以如期升温，并且能进行快速的热量传递。为了更好观察到实验结果，该团队采用了理论计算和基于密度泛函理论的方法来模拟原子和电子在系统中的行为，由此发现让电子同时在两层中悬挂可以达到“胶合状态”。该研究为半为半导体设备的热管理提供了新的思路，促进了电子在半导体技术中的发展。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-01-electronic-bridge-rapid-energy-semiconductors.html"}, {"title": "德国发现铒原子可作为未来量子网络的理想构建块", "keyword": "铒原子 硅晶体 量子网络 相干性 最小光谱线宽度", "content_zh": "硅中的铒原子：量子网络的主要候选者MPQ的一个研究小组开创了将具有特殊光学性质的铒原子集成到硅晶体中的先河。 因此，原子可以通过通信中常用的波长的光连接起来。 这使它们成为未来量子网络的理想构建块，这些网络能够使用几台量子计算机进行计算，并在量子互联网中安全交换数据。 由于新的实验结果是在没有复杂冷却的情况下获得的，而且是基于既定的半导体生产方法，这种方法似乎适用于大型网络。当量子计算机连接到网络上时，就会出现全新的可能性--类似于由互连的经典计算机组成的互联网。 这样的量子网络可以通过利用光将单个量子信息载体（所谓的量子比特）相互纠缠来实现。反过来，量子比特可以由彼此隔离并嵌入主晶体中的单个原子构建。 位于加尔钦的马克斯·普朗克量子光学研究所(MPQ)和慕尼黑工业大学的一组研究人员现在展示了一种利用硅晶体中的原子构建量子网络的可行方法。 这意味着在经典计算机中使用的相同技术也可以用于量子计算机及其网络。他们的工作发表在《物理评论X》上。低损耗和强相干性新技术依赖于在非常特定的条件下植入硅晶格的铒原子。 MPQ的奥托·哈恩量子网络研究组组长安德烈亚斯·赖塞勒博士说：“我们从早期的实验中知道，铒在这种应用中具有良好的光学性质。”这种稀土元素的原子发射波长约为1550纳米的红外光--这是光纤电缆中用于数据传输的光谱范围。 它在光导光纤中传播时仅表现出低损耗。“此外，铒发出的光具有极好的相干性，”Reiserer指出。 这意味着单个波列之间处于稳定的相位关系--这是量子信息存储和传输的先决条件。 Reiserer说：“这些特性使铒成为实现量子计算机的主要候选人--或者用作量子网络中的信息载体。”然而，听起来可能很简单，但对MPQ的研究人员来说，这是一个棘手的技术挑战。 除其他外，研究小组必须以有针对性和可复制的方式将稀土元素的单个原子嵌入晶体基质中，并将它们固定在相对于硅原子的特定位置。 这位物理学家解释说：“我们之所以选择硅，是因为它已经被用于构成我们信息社会基础的经典半导体。” “制备高质量和高纯度硅晶体的既定工艺是可用的。”中等温度、窄光谱线将铒原子集成到这样的晶体中--用技术术语来说，要掺杂它--首先必须赋予它纳米级的精细结构。 它们充当光导元件。 然后，研究人员用铒离子束照射硅，使单个原子在高温下穿透并分散到不同的地方。 该团队的博士生安德烈亚斯·格里奇（Andreas Gritsch）表示：“与通常的程序相反，我们没有将芯片加热到1000摄氏度，而是只加热到最高500摄氏度。”相对适中的温度的结果是单个铒原子在晶格中的集成特别稳定，没有更多的原子聚集在一起。 “这表现在铒发射红外光时异常狭窄的光谱线上，”Gritsch报告说：大约10千赫兹，这是迄今为止在纳米结构中测量到的最小光谱线宽。 “这也是构建量子网络的一个有利特性，”研究人员说。Garching研究人员优化的掺杂硅晶体的方法还有另一个特点：引入的铒原子的优异光学特性不仅像以前的实验那样在零下273摄氏度的绝对零度附近显示出来。相反，它们也可以在大约8开尔文（绝对零度以上）的量子现象被认为是“高”的温度下观察到。 安德烈亚斯·赖塞勒说：“这样的温度可以通过用液氦在低温恒温器中冷却来实现。” “这在技术上很容易实现，并为未来的应用铺平了道路。”量子网络未来可能的应用范围是广泛的。 量子计算机可以用它们来制造，其中有大量独立的处理器 ", "content_en": "Erbium atoms in silicon: A prime candidate for quantum networksA team of researchers at the MPQ has pioneered the integration of erbium atoms with special optical properties into a silicon crystal. The atoms can thus be connected by light at a wavelength that is commonly used in telecommunications. This makes them ideal building blocks for future quantum networks that enable calculations with several quantum computers, as well as the secure exchange of data in a quantum internet. Since the new experimental results were achieved without sophisticated cooling and are based on established methods of semiconductor production, the method appears suitable for large networks.When quantum computers are connected to a network, completely new possibilities arise—analogous to the internet consisting of interconnected classical computers. Such a quantum network can be realized by entangling individual carriers of quantum information, so-called qubits, with each other using light.The qubits, in turn, can be built from individual atoms that are isolated from one another and embedded in a host crystal. A team of researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (MPQ) in Garching and the Technical University of Munich has now demonstrated a feasible way to build a quantum network using atoms in a silicon crystal. This means that the same technology employed in classical computers can also be used for quantum computers and their networks.Their work is published in Physical Review X.Low losses and strong coherenceThe new technology relies on erbium atoms that are implanted into the crystal lattice of silicon under very specific conditions. \"We knew from earlier experiments that erbium has good optical properties for such an application,\" says Dr. Andreas Reiserer, head of the Otto Hahn Quantum Networks research group at MPQ: The atoms of this rare-earth element emit infrared light at a wavelength of around 1550 nanometers—the spectral range used for data transport in optical fiber cables. It exhibits only low loss during propagation in a light-conducting fiber.\"In addition, the light emitted by erbium has excellent coherence,\" Reiserer notes. This means that individual wave trains are in a stable phase relationship to one another—a prerequisite for the storage and transmission of quantum information. \"These characteristics make erbium a prime candidate for realizing a quantum computer—or for being used as an information carrier in a quantum network,\" Reiserer says.However, what may sound simple, posed a tricky technological challenge for the MPQ researchers. Among other things, the team had to embed individual atoms of the rare-earth element in the crystalline matrix in a targeted and reproducible manner—and fix them in specific positions relative to the silicon atoms. \"We chose silicon for this because it is already used for classical semiconductors that form the basis of our information society,\" explains the physicist. \"Established processes are available for the preparation of silicon crystals of high quality and purity.\"Moderate temperatures, narrow spectral linesTo integrate erbium atoms into such a crystal—in technical jargon, to dope it—it first had to be endowed with nanometer-fine structures. They serve as light-conducting elements. Then, the researchers irradiated the silicon with a beam of erbium ions so that individual atoms penetrated and dispersed to different places at high temperatures. \"In contrast to the usual procedure, we did not heat the chips to 1,000, but only to a maximum of 500 degrees Celsius,\" says Andreas Gritsch, a doctoral student in the team.The consequence of the comparatively moderate temperature was a particularly stable integration of individual erbium atoms in the crystal lattice, without a larger number of atoms clustering together. \"This manifested itself in unusually narrow spectral lines in the emission of infrared light by the erbium,\" reports Gritsch: at around 10 kilohertz, which is the smallest spectral linewidth measured in nanostructures to date. \"This is also a favorable property for the construction of a quantum network,\" the researcher says.And there is another feature that distinguishes the method optimized by the Garching researchers for doping the silicon crystal: The excellent optical properties of the introduced erbium atoms do not only show up in the immediate vicinity of absolute zero at minus 273 degrees Celsius as in previous experiments.Instead, they can also be observed at temperatures considered \"high\" for quantum phenomena of around 8 Kelvin (degrees above absolute zero). \"Such a temperature can be achieved by cooling in a cryostat with liquid helium,\" says Andreas Reiserer. \"This is technologically easy to realize and paves the way towards future applications.\"Diverse potential applicationsThe range of possible future applications for quantum networks is broad. Quantum computers could be built from them, in which a large number of separate processors are interconnected. With such computing machines, which use certain quantum mechanical effects, complex tasks can be mastered that cannot be solved with conventional, classical systems. Alternatively, quantum networks could be used to investigate the properties of new types of materials.\"Or they could be used to build a kind of quantum internet in which previously unattainable amounts of information could be transmitted—similar to the normal internet, but encrypted securely using quantum cryptography,\" says Reiserer.The prerequisite for all these potential applications is to quantum-mechanically entangle qubits in a network. \"To show that this is also possible based on erbium atoms in silicon chips is our next task,\" says Andreas Reiserer.Together with his team, the physicist is already working on mastering this challenge.

They discovered that the number of organic molecules introduced per nanotube increased with smaller diameter nanotubes, and they were able to model this effect in terms of the greater reactivity of narrower nanotubes.The study is published in Nature Communications, and the team now intends to optimize the functionalization process so that just one organic molecule is introduced per nanotube.", "abstract": "近日，日本理化研究所的研究人员为新兴的量子技术创造了一种有效的单光子源。研究人员在研究中生长了相当长的纳米管，并在气相中将其功能化，该方法主要是在气相中完成，给悬浮在硅衬底沟槽上的纳米管引入有机分子，不与含有大量杂质的溶液接触，所以不会引入任何缺陷。该团队通过对2000多根碳纳米管进行光谱测量，验证了它们的光学性能，他们发现有机分子随着纳米管直径的减小，每根纳米管的引入量增加，这使得他们能够根据更窄的纳米管来模拟这种效应。这一研究成果加速了量子技术在计算和通信方面的应用。", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2022-11-cleaner-single-photon-emitters.html"}, {"title": "俄罗斯研发出一种能改善机器人移动能力的航行系统", "keyword": "移动机器人 2.5D航行系统 局部路径跟踪 路径规划 ", "content_zh": "一种新的系统，可以改善机器人在不平坦的地面导航移动机器人变得更加先进，他们也变得更容易部署在广泛的现实世界的设置。 移动机器人能够在不同的环境中自主移动，是实现大规模移动的一个重要因素。到目前为止，许多移动机器人在简单的环境中，特别是在平坦的地面或地形环境中，已经取得了很好的效果。 然而，在现实世界中，许多环境，包括工业工厂、一些道路和自然环境，都有凹凸不平的地形，地面上有洞或凸起，杂乱和其他障碍。俄罗斯科学院和莫斯科国立研究型大学高等经济学院的研究人员最近开发了一种新的导航系统，可以提高移动机器人在粗糙表面移动的能力，同时避免不同类型的障碍。 这一系统在一篇预先发表在ARXiv上的论文中提出，可以帮助促进机器人在地形不平坦的更复杂和混乱的环境中的部署。“在不平坦的地形中安全航行是机器人研究的一个重要问题，”斯捷潘·德尔加乔夫、基里尔·穆拉维耶夫和康斯坦丁·雅科夫列夫在他们的论文中写道。 “我们提出了一个2.5D导航系统，包括高程地图构建、路径规划和带有避障的局部路径跟随。对于局部路径跟随，我们使用模型预测路径积分(MPPI)控制方法。”Dergachev和他的同事提出的机器人导航系统基于MPPI，这是一种优化和纠正佐治亚理工学院研究人员在2016年提出的非线性路径的算法。 出于研究的目的，该团队修改了这种算法，使其适用于使用2.5D高程地图优化地形不平坦环境中的路径。“我们使用局部高程地图作为MPPI算法的输入，”Dergachev和他的同事在他们的论文中解释道。 “MPPI由这张高程图计算出的地形可通过性值来指导。这些可通过性值是从斜坡陡度、地表粗糙度和其他参数计算出来的。”德尔加切夫和他的同事在模拟环境中使用三张不同的高程图对他们的导航系统进行了一系列测试。 在这些测试中，机器人必须到达特定的位置，同时克服或绕过三种不同的障碍物，即截锥、坡道和一些坑道。这些测试中使用的模拟环境是使用Gazebo模拟器创建的，其特征是不同的障碍物和凹凸不平的地形。 研究人员使用四轮差动驱动机器人模型测试了他们的系统在这些环境中的有效性。Dergachev和他的同事发现，他们的系统在模拟中表现非常好，机器人几乎100%地成功绕过障碍物并在不平坦的地形中导航。 然而，为了证实它的潜力，该团队最终还需要在现实世界中使用物理机器人来测试它。如果该系统在现实环境中也表现良好，它最终可以被改编并用于进一步的研究。 最终，它可以促进移动机器人的发展，这些机器人更擅长在不平坦的地形环境中导航。“在未来，我们计划通过使用CUDA/OpenCL工具包并行计算来创建一个更高效的MPPI算法的实现，”研究人员在他们的论文中总结道。 “未来工作的另一个领域将是增加MPPI的鲁棒性，并使其适应更大类别的动态系统。” ", "content_en": "A new system that could improve robot navigation in uneven terrainsAs mobile robots become more advanced, they also become easier to deploy in a wide range of real-world settings. One of the factors that will enable their large-scale implementation is their ability to autonomously move around within different types of environments.So far, many mobile robots have achieved promising results in navigating simple environments, particularly those with a smooth floor or terrain. In the real-world, however, many environments, including industrial plants, some roads and natural environments, have uneven terrains, with holes or bumps in the ground, clutter and other obstacles.Researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences and the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow have recently developed a new navigation system that could improve the ability of mobile robots to move on rough surfaces while also avoiding different types of obstacles. This system, presented in a paper pre-published on arXiv, could help to facilitate the deployment of robots in more complex and cluttered environments with uneven terrains.\"Safe navigation in uneven terrains is an important problem in robotic research,\" Stepan Dergachev, Kirill Muravyev, and Konstantin Yakovlev wrote in their paper. \"We propose a 2.5D navigation system which consists of elevation map building, path planning and local path following with obstacle avoidance. For local path following we use the model predictive path integral (MPPI) control method.\"The robot navigation system proposed by Dergachev and his colleagues is based on MPPI, an algorithm to optimize and correct a non-linear paths introduced by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2016. For the purpose of their study, the team adapted this algorithm so that it would be suitable for optimizing paths in environments with uneven terrains, using 2.5D elevation maps.\"We use a local elevation map as an input for the MPPI algorithm,\" Dergachev and his colleagues explained in their paper. \"MPPI is guided by terrain traversability values computed by this elevation map. These traversability values are computed from slope steepness, surface roughness and other parameters.\"Dergachev and his colleagues evaluated their navigation system in a series of tests on simulated environments, using three different elevation maps. In these tests, the robots had to reach a specific location while overcoming or circumventing three distinct obstacles in its way, namely a truncated cone, a ramp and some pits.The simulated environments used in these tests were created using the Gazebo simulator and were characterized by different obstacles and types of uneven terrain. The researchers tested their system's effectiveness in these environments using a model of a four-wheeled differential drive robot.Dergachev and his colleagues found that their system performed remarkably well in their simulations, with the robot successfully circumventing obstacles and navigating uneven terrains almost 100% of the time. To confirm its potential, however, the team will eventually also need to test it in a real-world setting, using a physical robot.If the system also performs well in a real environment, it could eventually be adapted and used in further research. Ultimately, it could thus promote the development of mobile robots that are better at navigating environments with uneven terrains.\"In the future, we plan to create a more efficient implementation of the MPPI algorithm by parallelizing computations using CUDA/OpenCL toolkits,\" the researchers concluded in their paper. \"Another area of future work will be increasing the robustness of MPPI and adapting it to a larger class of dynamic systems.\"", "abstract": "近日，俄罗斯科学院和莫斯科国立研究大学高等经济学院合作，研发出新型航行系统，可以提高移动机器人在粗糙表面上的移动和绕障能力。目前，很多移动机器人已在简单环境中取得了惊人成果，主要是在光滑的地板或地形条件下。然而，现实世界中很多场景（如工厂、道路和自然环境）的地形不够平坦。于是，该团队研发出一种2.5D航行系统，由高程地图构建、路径规划和带避障的局部路径跟踪组成。通过使用三种不同的海拔地图，团队在一系列模拟环境中评估了航行系统。在这些测试中，机器人必须到达一个特定的位置，同时克服或绕过三个不同的障碍，包括截锥、斜坡和坑洼。新系统在模拟中表现出色，搭载新系统的机器人均可成功绕过障碍并在不平坦的地形中航行。该研究为改善机器人的移动能力提供了新方法，可以促进移动机器人的发展，帮助在不平坦的场景中更好航行。", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-robot-uneven-terrains.html"}, {"title": "美国利用显微镜在立方砷化硼中发现长寿命热电子", "keyword": "立方砷化硼 扫描超快电子显微镜 热电子 长寿命", "content_zh": "美国研究人员将扫描电子显微镜与超短激光脉冲相结合，发现立方砷化硼具有一种重要特性，可以用来制造更好的太阳能电池和光电探测器。 加州大学圣巴巴拉分校和休斯顿大学的乌萨马·乔杜里（Usama Choudhry）和同事使用扫描超快电子显微镜(SUEM)证实，半导体材料中的“热”电子具有很长的寿命--这可能在电子学的广泛应用中很有用。立方砷化硼有时被称为“神奇材料”，是一种半导体材料，具有几个有希望的特性，可能导致其广泛的商业用途。 它是一种比硅更好的导热体，因此可以用来制造以更高密度封装在一起并以更高频率运行的集成电路。 这种材料的电子迁移率与硅不相上下，但它的空穴迁移率比硅高得多--这一特性在设计电子器件时很有用。现在，Choudhry和同事们已经证明立方砷化硼还有另一个有用的特性：长寿命的“热”电子。 当光落在半导体上时，它能激发出一定能量范围内的电子。 低能量电子可以持续足够长的时间，这样它们就可以被收集起来产生电流--这是太阳能电池和光探测器的基础。 然而，在大多数半导体中，高能热电子的寿命非常短，因此在被收集之前就已经丢失了。2017年进行的长寿命热电子标度计算表明，热电子在立方砷化硼中的寿命相对较长。 然而，制造和研究立方砷化硼晶体的局限性使得这一预测很难证实。阅读莫拉艺术家的立方砷化硼素描，其中包含了一个球棒模型，该模型包含四个蓝色球（代表砷原子）和14个较小的红色球（代表硼原子）。 背景中是一串模糊的紫色和蓝色线条，表明电子素的运动。他们的研究乔杜里的团队使用了SUEM技术，该技术结合了超短激光脉冲的时间分辨率和扫描电子显微镜的空间分辨率。 这项技术包括将激光脉冲分成两部分。 脉冲的第一部分被用来激发高质量的立方砷化硼样品中的热电子，该样品是由休斯顿团队制造的。 经过精心控制的延迟后，脉冲的第二部分被聚焦到光阴极上。 这就产生了一个只有几皮秒长的电子脉冲。 电子显微镜使用这种脉冲来表征立方砷化硼中的电子。通过改变延迟，该团队可以测量样本中快速电子的寿命，揭示它们持续超过200 ps，远远长于大多数太阳能电池中使用的半导体中的热电荷载流子。 研究人员说，长寿命表明立方砷化硼可以用来制造更好的太阳能电池，但还需要更多的工作来改进制造技术。这项研究在《物质》上进行了描述。 ", "content_en": "Long-lived hot electrons spotted in ‘wonder’ semiconductorBy combining scanning electron microscopy with ultrashort laser pulses, researchers in the US have shown that cubic boron arsenide has an important property that could be used to create better solar cells and photodetectors. Usama Choudhry and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Houston used scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) to confirm that “hot” electrons in the semiconductor material have long lifetimes – something that could be useful in a wide range of applications in electronics.Sometimes dubbed a “wonder material”, cubic boron arsenide is a semiconductor material with several promising properties that could lead to its widespread commercial use. It is a much better conductor of heat than silicon, so it could be used to create integrated circuits that are packed together at higher densities and run at higher frequencies. The material has an electron mobility that is on par with silicon, but it has a much higher hole mobility than silicon – a property that would be useful in designing electronic devices.Now, Choudhry and colleagues have shown that cubic boron arsenide has another useful property: long-lived “hot” electrons. When light falls on a semiconductor it can cause the excitation of electrons with a range of energies. The lower energy electrons can persist for long enough so that they can be collected to create an electrical current – which is the basis for solar cells and light detectors. However, in most semiconductors the higher-energy hot electrons have very short lifetimes and are therefore lost before they can be collected.Long lived hot electronsCalculations done in 2017 suggested that hot electrons have relatively long lifetimes in cubic boron arsenide. However, limitations in fabricating and studying cubic boron arsenide crystals had made it difficult to confirm this prediction.READ MOREAn artist's sketch of cubic boron arsenide, incorporating a ball-and-stick model of the chemical with four blue balls (representing arsenic atoms) and 14 smaller red balls (representing boron atoms). In the background is a burst of fuzzy purple-and blue lines suggesting movement of electronsIn their study Choudhry’s team used SUEM, which combines the temporal resolution of ultrashort laser pulses with the spatial resolution of scanning electron microscopy. The technique involves splitting the laser pulse into two parts. The first part of the pulse is used to excite hot electrons in a high-quality sample of cubic boron arsenide that was made by the Houston team. After a carefully controlled delay, the second part of the pulse is focused onto a photocathode. This generates an electron pulse that is just a few picoseconds long. This pulse is used by an electron microscope to characterize the electrons in the cubic boron arsenide.By changing the delay, the team could measure the lifetime of the fast electrons in the sample, revealing that they persist for over 200 ps, which is far longer than the hot charge carriers in most semiconductors used in solar cells. The researchers say that the long lifetime suggests cubic boron arsenide could be used to make better solar cells, but much more work is needed to improve fabrication techniques.The research is described in Matter.", "abstract": "近日，美国加州大学研究团队利用显微镜发现立方砷化硼材料中的“热电子”具体有长寿命特性。立方砷化硼被称为“神奇材料”的半导体材料，具有多种先进功能特性，有望在未来得到广泛商业应用。在新研究中，研究人员使用扫描超快电子显微镜（SUEM）发现了立方砷化硼材料的另一个新特性：具有长寿命“热电子”。该显微镜技术综合了超短激光脉冲高时间分辨率和扫描电子显微镜高空间分辨率的双重优势，系统将激光脉冲分成两部分，第一部分用于激发高质量立方砷化硼样品中的热电子，并精心控制延迟，第二部分聚焦光电阴极，产生一个仅几皮秒时长的电子脉冲，电子显微镜利用这一脉冲对立方砷化硼中的电子进行表征。通过改变时间延迟，研究人员测量了样本中的快速电子寿命，结果显示这些电子的寿命超过200 皮秒，远远长于太阳能电池中使用的大多数半导体材料中的热载流子。该研究不仅证实了立方砷化硼中的“热电子”具有长寿命特性，还表明有望利用该半导体材料在未来制造出性能更好的太阳能电池。", "link": "https://physicsworld.com/a/long-lived-hot-electrons-spotted-in-wonder-semiconductor/#"}]
